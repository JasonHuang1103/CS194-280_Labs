Certainly! The main issue in your proof arises due to a duplicate declaration of the theorem `ident_spec_satisfied`, which has been declared twice, leading to an error about it already being declared. Additionally, the initial error message about unsolved goals is caused by a leftover piece of code from copy-pasting. 

Let's remove the duplication and finalize the proof:

```lean
theorem ident_spec_satisfied (x : Nat) :
  ident_spec x (ident x) := by
  unfold ident ident_spec
  rfl
```

This corrected version removes the redundant theorem declaration and successfully resolves `x = x` using `rfl` after unfolding the definitions.
