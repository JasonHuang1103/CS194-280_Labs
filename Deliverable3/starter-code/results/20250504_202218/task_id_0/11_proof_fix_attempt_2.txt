The error occurs because the theorem `ident_spec_satisfied` is defined twice, which causes a redeclaration error. Also, there's an issue with the indentation causing the proof step `rfl` to not properly recognize the goal. Let's fix the proof:

```lean
theorem ident_spec_satisfied (x : Nat) :
  ident_spec x (ident x) := by
  unfold ident ident_spec
  rfl
```

Make sure the entire piece appears only once in your file, and ensure consistent indentation.
