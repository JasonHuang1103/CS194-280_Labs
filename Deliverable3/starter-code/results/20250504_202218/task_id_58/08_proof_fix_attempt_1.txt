Here is the corrected proof:

```lean
theorem hasOppositeSign_spec_satisfied (a : Int) (b : Int) :
  hasOppositeSign_spec a b (hasOppositeSign a b) := by
  unfold hasOppositeSign hasOppositeSign_spec
  apply Iff.intro
  case mp =>
    intro h
    cases h
    case inl h₁ =>
      simp only [h₁.left, h₁.right, Bool.true_iff, Bool.or_true, and_self]
    case inr h₂ =>
      simp only [h₂.left, h₂.right, Bool.true_iff, Bool.true_or, and_self]
  case mpr =>
    intro h
    simp only [Bool.or_eq_true] at h
    cases h
    case inl h₁ =>
      left
      apply And.intro
      case left =>
        exact of_decide_eq_true h₁.left
      case right =>
        exact of_decide_eq_true h₁.right
    case inr h₂ =>
      right
      apply And.intro
      case left =>
        exact of_decide_eq_true h₂.left
      case right =>
        exact of_decide_eq_true h₂.right
```

### Explanation:
1. **Remove Duplicate Theorem Statement**: The theorem was declared twice, remove the redundant declaration.
2. **Proof Adjustment**: Fixed the proof structure to properly handle the unfolding and simplifications. Instead of duplicating the same tactic calls, the proof uses `simp` in a more structured way to handle specifics for each case splitting on logic.
3. **Clarification and Correction**: Use `of_decide_eq_true` to convert `decide` (`Bool`) to `Prop` to ensure correct handling of the logic.
4. **Error Handling**: Handle each case using `cases` on the result of `Bool.or_eq_true` for better clarity and correct assumption applications.

Ensure no duplicate declarations and the correct use of tactics to handle logical simplifications and case splits.
