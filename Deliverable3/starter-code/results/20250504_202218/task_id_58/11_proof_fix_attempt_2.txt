Certainly! The primary issue is that the proof has an unnecessary second declaration of `hasOppositeSign_spec_satisfied`. Additionally, the error in the unfolding part is related to the way we're handling boolean expressions and their equivalence to propositions. Let's clean up the proof and correct these points:

Here's the corrected proof:

```lean
theorem hasOppositeSign_spec_satisfied (a : Int) (b : Int) :
  hasOppositeSign_spec a b (hasOppositeSign a b) := by
  unfold hasOppositeSign hasOppositeSign_spec
  apply Iff.intro
  case mp =>
    intro h
    cases h
    case inl h₁ =>
      simp only [Bool.or_true, Bool.and_true, Bool.true_iff] 
      rw [←decide_eq_true h₁.left, ←decide_eq_true h₁.right]
      simp
    case inr h₂ =>
      simp only [Bool.true_or, Bool.and_true, Bool.true_iff]
      rw [←decide_eq_true h₂.left, ←decide_eq_true h₂.right]
      simp
  case mpr =>
    intro h
    cases h <;> cases Bool.or_eq_true.mp h
    case inl h₁ =>
      left
      simp [decide_eq_true_iff] at h₁
      exact ⟨h₁.1, h₁.2⟩
    case inr h₂ =>
      right
      simp [decide_eq_true_iff] at h₂
      exact ⟨h₂.1, h₂.2⟩
```

In this version:
- We correctly manage the boolean being equivalent to propositions using `decide_eq_true` and `decide_eq_true_iff`.
- We fixed the duplication of theorem declarations.
- We used tactical steps to correctly match the structure expected in the context of Lean's boolean decision process versus logical truths.
