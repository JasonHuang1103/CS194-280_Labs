Below is a plan that explains the key steps for how to implement the function and prove that it meets its specification.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Implementation of hasOppositeSign

• Use the problem statement: Return true exactly when one integer is positive and the other is negative. In other words, when either
  a < 0 and b > 0  or  a > 0 and b < 0.
• Note that if any number is zero it does not pass either condition. (Zero is neither positive nor negative.)
• A straightforward implementation is to “combine” the two conditions using the Boolean or:
  hasOppositeSign a b = (a < 0 ∧ b > 0) ∨ (a > 0 ∧ b < 0)
• Since Lean typically distinguishes between Prop and Bool (and the “if … then … else” syntax requires Bool conditions) you must be sure that the comparisons a < 0 and a > 0 yield Bool values. 

  – One approach is to use if-then-else:
  if (a < 0 && b > 0) then true
  else if (a > 0 && b < 0) then true
  else false
  – Alternatively, Lean’s Boolean operators (&&, ||) and conditions can be given instances of decidability automatically when importing Mathlib. So you might also write the implementation as:
  def hasOppositeSign (a : Int) (b : Int) : Bool :=
    (a < 0 && b > 0) || (a > 0 && b < 0)
  
  Choose the style that best fits the Lean 4 environment (and mathlib’s provided instances).

Step 2. Stating the Specification

• The specification is given as:
  (a < 0 ∧ b > 0) ∨ (a > 0 ∧ b < 0) ↔ result
• Here result is the output of hasOppositeSign. Notice that both the left-hand side and right-hand side are “booleans” (or can be interpreted as such) once you give the right definition to hasOppositeSign.
• In the theorem “hasOppositeSign_spec_satisfied”, you need to show that the computed value (from your definition) is logically equivalent (using the ↔) to the disjunction of the two cases.

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. Devising the Proof Strategy (for hasOppositeSign_spec_satisfied)

• Unfold Definitions:
  – Begin the proof by unfolding the definitions of hasOppositeSign and hasOppositeSign_spec.
  – This will expose the if-then-else (or Boolean operators) in your implementation.
    
• Case Analysis or Rewriting:
  – If you used the if-then-else construction, do a case split on the conditions.
  – For example, prove the equivalence by considering the true branch (when the condition [(a < 0 && b > 0) || (a > 0 && b < 0)] holds) and the false branch separately.
  – If you implemented hasOppositeSign as a direct Boolean combination, it is often the case that the result is definitionally equal to the condition, so the equivalence follows by reflexivity (rfl) or by a simple Boolean rewrite.
    
• Use Built-In Automation:
  – Lean’s built-in tactics (and even Aesop) might simplify the Boolean expressions.
  – You can use tactics like simp, exact, or rfl where applicable to complete the proof.

──────────────────────────────
Step 4. Wrap-up

• Once the proof is complete, review that:
  – All cases where one integer is zero automatically fall into “false”.
  – The function and the specification match exactly.
    
• If any type conversion issues between propositions (Prop) and booleans (Bool) arise, consider using a helper lemma or the equivalence (of_bool or similar) provided by mathlib to bridge the gap.

Summary

1. Write the function so it returns true exactly when (a < 0 ∧ b > 0) or (a > 0 ∧ b < 0), and false otherwise.
2. Express the specification as an equivalence between the disjunction and the result.
3. In the proof, unfold the definitions and use case analysis or simplification tactics to show that the definition of hasOppositeSign exactly corresponds to the specification in all cases.
4. Validate that the treatment of zeros is correct (since zero won’t satisfy a < 0 or a > 0).

This plan outlines the key steps to implement and prove the function as required.
