Below is one way to think about and structure the solution.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Understanding the Problem

• The function must take a natural number (x of type Nat) as input and return that same number.
• That is, ident x should equal x for every natural number x.
• The specification ident_spec states exactly that: result = x.

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Breaking Down the Problem

We have two parts to complete:

1. Implementation of the function
   • The function is the identity function on Nat.
   • Thus, we simply need to return the same input x.

2. Proof that the function meets its specification
   • The theorem ident_spec_satisfied states:
       ident_spec x (ident x) 
     Since ident_spec x result is defined as (result = x), we must show:
       ident x = x
   • Once we unfold the definitions, our goal reduces to showing x = x.
   • This is a trivial proof by reflexivity (rfl in Lean).

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. Considering Inputs, Edge Cases, and Expected Behavior

• The input is a natural number.
• Since the identity function has no real edge cases (it doesn’t change the input), for all x : Nat, x is returned.
• Our proof will work for every natural number without any additional case analysis.

──────────────────────────────
Step 4. Choosing Appropriate Proof Techniques

• When proving the identity (x = x), the tactic rfl (which applies the reflexivity of equality) is sufficient.
• We can also use unfold to replace definitions with their bodies and then apply rfl.

──────────────────────────────
Step 5. Relating to Similar Examples

• In many Lean examples from the documentation, one sees simple proofs like example : 2 + 3 = 5 := rfl.
• Our case is analogous: after unfolding, the goal is x = x.
• Thus, we follow the same pattern: unfold definitions and end with rfl.

──────────────────────────────
Detailed Plan for Implementation and Proof

1. For the implementation, set ident (x : Nat) to simply be x.
2. For the theorem ident_spec_satisfied, start by unfolding the definitions of ident and ident_spec. This reveals the goal:
     x = x
3. Conclude the proof by applying rfl.

-- Specification: the output result must equal the input, i.e., result = x.
def ident_spec (x : Nat) (result : Nat) : Prop :=

  result = x

-- Proof that ident satisfies the specification: 
theorem ident_spec_satisfied (x : Nat) :

  -- Unfold the definitions to see that our goal is to show x = x.
  unfold ident ident_spec

Conclusion

This plan outlines that the function simply returns its input and the proof uses unraveling of the definitions followed by the reflexivity tactic. This exactly meets the requirements provided.
