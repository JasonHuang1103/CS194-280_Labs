Below is the step‐by‐step analysis of what is going wrong and how to fix it.

1. Identifying the Failing Tactic

 • The error message says that in both “case pos” (when a ≤ b) and “case neg” (when ¬(a ≤ b)) there are “unsolved goals.”
 • The proof is written using a by‐case analysis on the condition “a ≤ b” (using by_cases h : a ≤ b). In the first branch the tactic "rw [if_pos h]" is used with “exact …” to close that case; then afterward the proof script continues with “rw [if_neg h]” and so on.
 • The error “unexpected identifier; expected command” indicates that Lean got confused by a command that is not “attached” to one of the two cases.
 • Thus the failing tactic is “rw [if_neg h]” (and the subsequent tactics) which Lean cannot associate with the proper branch. In other words, the tactics for the “if_neg” branch are not correctly delimited into their own block.

─────────────────────────────

2. Considering the Proof State

 • In the positive case (when h : a ≤ b), after “rw [if_pos h]” the goal becomes

  ((a ≤ a ∧ a ≤ b) ∧ ((a = a) ∨ (a = b)))

 which is then solved by “exact ⟨⟨le_refl a, h⟩, Or.inl rfl⟩.”
 • In the negative case (when ¬ (a ≤ b)), the intended rewriting is “rw [if_neg h]”, followed by a “have” statement and an “exact …” to show that the result is b.
 • However, because the tactics are not separated (by braces or indentation), Lean is not sure which commands belong to which branch. In the proof state Lean sees unsolved goals for both cases.

─────────────────────────────

3. Matching the Proof Approach With the Specification

 • The specification is that myMin_spec a b (myMin a b) should hold. Since 
  myMin a b := if a ≤ b then a else b,
  one should indeed prove it by considering two cases:
   (A) if a ≤ b, then myMin a b is a and the inequalities (a ≤ a and a ≤ b) hold,
   (B) if ¬(a ≤ b), then myMin a b is b and the appropriate inequalities hold.
 • The overall strategy is perfectly correct. The error is not in the mathematical idea but in how the by‐case proof is structured in Lean.

─────────────────────────────

4. Type Mismatches or Incorrect Assumptions

 • There are no type mismatches in the “exact” parts and the use of appropriate lemmas 
  (such as le_refl, lt_of_not_le, etc.). 
 • The only “mismatch” is that the two branches of the case analysis (one using if_pos and the other 
  using if_neg) aren’t being kept separate. This is a problem of tactic structure, not of types or logic.

─────────────────────────────

5. Alternative Proof Strategies

 • One fix is to “group” the tactics belonging to each case with braces. For example, you can rewrite the proof as

  theorem myMin_spec_satisfied (a : Int) (b : Int) :
    myMin_spec a b (myMin a b) := by
    unfold myMin myMin_spec
    by_cases h : a ≤ b
    { rw [if_pos h],
      exact ⟨⟨le_refl a, h⟩, Or.inl rfl⟩ }
    { rw [if_neg h],
      have : b < a := lt_of_not_le h,
      exact ⟨⟨le_of_lt this, le_refl b⟩, Or.inr rfl⟩ }

 • Another approach is to use the “cases” syntax (or the new “by_cases … with …” syntax) so that each branch’s proof is clearly delimited.
 • This way Lean will know that the commands inside the braces belong to one branch and that there are two separate subgoals to be solved.

Conclusion and Root Cause

The root cause is that after using “by_cases h : a ≤ b,” the subsequent tactic commands are not grouped into separate branches. In Lean, each branch of a case analysis must be given its own (indented or braced) block of tactics. Since the “rw [if_neg h]”, “have …”, and “exact …” commands for the negative case are not in a separate block, Lean sees a stray “rw” (or does not know which subgoal it should act on) and reports unsolved goals as well as a parsing error.

To fix the issue, you should group the tactics for each branch—for example, by adding braces { … } after the “by_cases” line. This will ensure that Lean understands which commands belong to the positive case and which to the negative case, and then each case will be properly finished.
