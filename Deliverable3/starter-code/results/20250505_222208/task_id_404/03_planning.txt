We want to build a function that receives two integers a and b and returns the smaller one. When a equals b, returning either value is acceptable. We must also provide a theorem stating that the returned value (call it result) satisfies two properties:
 – It is less than or equal to a and b.
 – It is equal to either a or b.

Below is our step‐by‐step reasoning:

───────────────────────────── 
Step 1. Understand the Function Specification

• Our function myMin : Int → Int → Int must compare a and b.  
• If a is less than or equal to b, then a is “the minimum.”  
• Otherwise (if a > b) the minimum is b.  
• In the case a = b the “if” branch (a <= b) applies so we will return a. (Recall that the “if” test is “a <= b”, which returns true in the equal case because ≤ is reflexive.)

───────────────────────────── 
Step 2. Break the Problem into Parts

• PART A: Implementation  
 – We can use Lean’s conditional “if … then … else …” construct.
 – Thus our function implementation will look like  
  if a <= b then a else b  
• PART B: Specification and Proof  
 – The specification predicate myMin_spec a b result must say:
  (result ≤ a ∧ result ≤ b) ∧ (result = a ∨ result = b)
 – To prove that our implementation satisfies the specification we will do a case analysis on the condition (a ≤ b) that occurs in the implementation.

───────────────────────────── 
Step 3. Consider Input Types and Edge Cases

• Our inputs are integers (of type Int).  
• Edge cases include:
 – a = b (in which case our “if” test is true so we return a – which is acceptable)
 – When a < b or b < a.  
• In every case, note that the “if … then … else …” returns either a or b.

───────────────────────────── 
Step 4. Plan the Proof Techniques

• Since our implementation is defined by an “if … then … else …” we can use Lean’s “split_ifs” tactic (or manual cases using “by_cases”) to split the proof into two cases.
• In the “if (a <= b)” case the result is a; then:
 – We need to show a ≤ a (true by reflexivity) and a ≤ b (which is exactly the hypothesis from the if branch).
 – Also, a = a holds (so we can choose the “or” case “result = a”).
• In the “else” case (when a ≤ b is false) we know by the properties of ≤ on integers that b < a. In that branch the output is b; then:
 – We need to show b ≤ a (which holds because b < a implies b ≤ a) and b ≤ b (true by reflexivity).
 – And b = b is trivial.
• Our proof will begin by “unfolding” our definitions to expose the “if … then … else …” and then use a “split_ifs” or “cases” tactic.

───────────────────────────── 
Step 5. Note Similar Patterns from Examples

• In many examples in Lean’s documentation (as seen above) one “splits” on an if–then–else.  
• The pattern we use is very similar to how one proves a conditional specification using cases based on the decision procedure (for example, many proofs about “min” functions use the same idea).

Detailed Plan for the Implementation and Proof

1. Implementation:
 Define the function myMin as follows:
  def myMin (a : Int) (b : Int) : Int :=
   if a <= b then a else b

2. Theorem Specification:
 We already have a predicate definition myMin_spec, which states:
  myMin_spec a b result  := (result ≤ a ∧ result ≤ b) ∧ (result = a ∨ result = b)

3. Proof Strategy:
 In theorem myMin_spec_satisfied, we must show:
  myMin_spec a b (myMin a b)
 The strategy is:
  a. Unfold the definitions (or simplify) so that the “if … then … else …” is visible.
  b. Use split_ifs (or a manual case split) to separate the two cases:
   • Case 1: Assume (a ≤ b) – then the returned result is a.
    – Prove that a ≤ a (by le_refl) and a ≤ b (directly from the assumption).
    – Prove that a = a holds (choose the left “or”).
   • Case 2: Assume ¬(a ≤ b) – then we know b < a from the properties of ordering on Int.
    – Then result = b.
    – Prove that b ≤ a (using b < a implies b ≤ a) and b ≤ b (by le_refl).
    – Prove that b = b holds.
  c. Conclude by reassembling the two cases, which each satisfy the specification.

Detailed Final Plan (Pseudo‐Lean Code)

Implementation:
---------------------------------
import Mathlib
import Aesop

def myMin (a : Int) (b : Int) : Int :=
  if a ≤ b then a else b

Specification predicate (as given):
---------------------------------
def myMin_spec (a : Int) (b : Int) (result : Int) : Prop :=
  (result ≤ a ∧ result ≤ b) ∧
  (result = a ∨ result = b)

Proof:
---------------------------------
theorem myMin_spec_satisfied (a : Int) (b : Int) :
  myMin_spec a b (myMin a b) := by
  -- Unfold the definitions to see the if-statement.
  unfold myMin myMin_spec
  split  -- This splits the conjunction into two goals.
  -- For the first part: result ≤ a ∧ result ≤ b.
  { split
    -- Now, we use a case split on the if condition.
    split_ifs with h
    -- Case: if h : (a ≤ b) holds, then myMin = a.
    { exact ⟨le_refl a, h⟩ }
    -- Case: else, so ¬(a ≤ b); then myMin = b.
    { -- Here we know b < a by properties of Int.
      have h₁ : b < a := lt_of_not_ge h
      exact ⟨le_of_lt h₁, le_refl b⟩ } }
  -- Next, for the second part: result = a ∨ result = b.
  { split_ifs with h
    -- Case: if (a ≤ b) then myMin = a so use left branch.
    { exact Or.inl rfl }
    -- Otherwise, myMin = b so use right branch.
    { exact Or.inr rfl } }

───────────────────────────── 
Conclusion

By following the above plan we:
 – Define myMin using an “if” based on the condition (a ≤ b).  
 – Prove by splitting on the if-condition that in one branch the result is a and in the other branch it is b.  
 – In both cases, we verify that the result is less than or equal to each input and that the result equals one of them.

This completes our detailed plan for both the implementation of the function and the accompanying proof.
