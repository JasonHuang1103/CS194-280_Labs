We eventually discovered that nothing “wrong” was done with the specification itself; rather, the problem was that the if–expression (the definition of myMin) was not reduced in the branches of the by‐cases, so that the goal still contained

  (if a ≤ b then a else b)

instead of the expected “a” (or “b”). (Also, the bullet “·” error is simply a consequence of the tactic parser not “seeing” a valid command because a goal remained unsolved.)

Let’s analyze the issue step‐by‐step:

───────────────────────────── 
1. Which tactic is failing and why

In each branch after “by_cases h : a ≤ b” you use 
  exact ⟨⟨…⟩, …⟩
to close the goal. However, in the “pos” branch (and likewise in the “neg” branch) the goal is

  ((if a ≤ b then a else b) ≤ a ∧ (if a ≤ b then a else b) ≤ b) ∧
  ((if a ≤ b then a else b) = a ∨ (if a ≤ b then a else b) = b).

Because we have merely unfolded the definition of myMin and myMin_spec, Lean still sees the term “if a ≤ b then a else b” in the goal – it does not automatically convert it to “a” even though the hypothesis h : a ≤ b holds. Then your “exact” tactic (with its rfl’s) fails because (for example) “(if a ≤ b then a else b) = a” does not convert definitionally to “a = a” unless you tell Lean to rewrite the if–expression.

───────────────────────────── 
2. What is the proof state at that point

After unfolding the definitions and in the “pos” branch we have:
 • a, b : ℤ and h : a ≤ b in the context.
 • The goal is still
  ((if a ≤ b then a else b) ≤ a ∧ (if a ≤ b then a else b) ≤ b) ∧
  ((if a ≤ b then a else b) = a ∨ (if a ≤ b then a else b) = b).

Since the if–statement has not been “computed” (or rewritten), the goal is not yet in the form where you can apply rfl (which only works when both sides are definitionally equal).

───────────────────────────── 
3. Does the proof approach match the specification?

Yes. The specification requires that the value computed by myMin be less than or equal to both a and b and be equal to either a or b. The proof divides into two cases by testing a ≤ b; in the first case (when a ≤ b) the computed value should be a, and in the second (when ¬(a ≤ b)) it should be b. That is exactly what the proof intends. The approach is correct; it is just that the “if” is not being reduced automatically to a or b.

───────────────────────────── 
4. Identifying type mismatches or incorrect assumptions

There is no “wrong” type or incorrect assumption per se. The issue is that when you “unfold myMin”, you end up with an if–expression instead of the expected a or b. For example, in the first branch you want to show:
  (if a ≤ b then a else b) = a,
but Lean does not automatically simplify this; you must instruct it to “rewrite” it by using the lemma if_pos.
Similarly, in the second branch you need to reduce “if a ≤ b then a else b” to b (using if_neg).

Also, note that the “·” bullet style (used in Lean 4) is showing an “unexpected token” error because the previous tactic did not solve its goal, and the parser couldn’t interpret the bullet correctly.

───────────────────────────── 
5. Considering alternative proof strategies

To fix the problem, you have two main options:

• In each branch, explicitly rewrite the if–expression:
  
  In the “pos” branch, after assuming h : a ≤ b, do
  rw [if_pos h]
 then use the exact tactic:
  exact ⟨⟨le_refl a, h⟩, Or.inl rfl⟩

• Alternatively, you can use a “simp” tactic (or “dsimp”) with appropriate lemmas (or use “split_if”) so that Lean automatically simplifies the if–expression.

For example, one corrected version might be:

  theorem myMin_spec_satisfied (a : Int) (b : Int) :
    myMin_spec a b (myMin a b) := by
   unfold myMin myMin_spec
   by_cases h : a ≤ b
   · rw [if_pos h]
     exact ⟨⟨le_refl a, h⟩, Or.inl rfl⟩
   · rw [if_neg h]
     have : b < a := lt_of_not_le h
     exact ⟨⟨le_of_lt this, le_refl b⟩, Or.inr rfl⟩

This tells Lean to simplify “if a ≤ b then a else b” to “a” (in the first branch) and to “b” (in the second branch) so that your rfl proofs match perfectly.

───────────────────────────── 
Conclusion and Root Cause Analysis

The root problem is that after unfolding myMin, the goal still contains a conditional (an if–expression) that does not reduce by itself even though you have a hypothesis (h : a ≤ b) that makes one of the branches “active.” Thus, the “exact” tactic (with rfl) fails because it cannot show that (if a ≤ b then a else b) is definitionally equal to a (or b, in the other branch).

To fix the proof, you should include a rewrite (or simplification) of the if–expression using the relevant rewrite lemma (if_pos or if_neg) before calling exact.

That is, the direction for fixing is to force the computation of the conditional expression so that the goal’s type exactly matches the expected form.
