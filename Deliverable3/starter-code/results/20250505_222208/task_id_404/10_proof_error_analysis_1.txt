We eventually discovered that nothing was “wrong” with the definition of myMin_spec itself – it was our proof script that was mis‐structured. In our by‐cases we tried to “constructor” three things even though the goal is only an “and” (∧) of two parts. In other words, our bullet (·) structure does not match the shape of the goal, and we even end up mis–using lemmas (for example, using Int.le_trans on h when what we really need is a reflexivity proof for a ≤ a in one branch, and a different lemma to show b ≤ a in the other branch). 

I will now explain step‐by‐step what went wrong and how to think about fixing it.

───────────────────────────── 
Step 1. Identify Which Tactic Is Failing and Why

In our proof we use the "by_cases h : a <= b" tactic. After unfolding myMin and myMin_spec the goal becomes
 ((if a ≤ b then a else b) ≤ a ∧ (if a ≤ b then a else b) ≤ b) ∧ ((if a ≤ b then a else b) = a ∨ (if a ≤ b then a else b) = b).

In the first branch (when h : a ≤ b) the “if” simplifies so that myMin a b is a; in the second branch it simplifies to b. In each branch our proof then immediately uses the tactic "constructor". (Remember that a proof of X ∧ Y can be built by “constructor” provided we supply a proof for X and then one for Y.)

However, in our script we then supply three bullet items after “constructor” rather than two. This is the first problem. Lean complains that some “goals” remain unsolved – indeed, the bullet structure does not match the structure (the goal is a conjunction of exactly two statements, not three) and then later the bullet symbol “·” appears in a place where Lean does not expect a tactic command.

───────────────────────────── 
Step 2. Consider the Proof State at That Point

After unfolding the definitions and doing by_cases, we have two cases:

• In the case h : a ≤ b the if–then–else simplifies so that:
 Result = a
and the goal becomes
 (a ≤ a ∧ a ≤ b) ∧ (a = a ∨ a = b).

In this branch the natural proofs would be:
 – a ≤ a is proved with le_refl,
 – a ≤ b is given by h,
 – and a = a is trivial (use left; rfl).

• In the case h : ¬ (a ≤ b) the if–then–else yields:
 Result = b
so we must prove
 (b ≤ a ∧ b ≤ b) ∧ (b = a ∨ b = b).

Here we notice that since ¬(a ≤ b) implies a > b, we can conclude b ≤ a (using the fact that a > b implies b ≤ a, for example by applying an appropriate “le_of_lt” after converting ¬(a ≤ b) into a < b). Then b ≤ b is trivial and b = b is given by rfl (so we use the “right” disjunct).

Thus, in each branch there are only two pieces to supply: one for the “ordering” conjunct and one for the “equality” conjunct.

───────────────────────────── 
Step 3. Check if the Proof Approach Matches the Specification

The specification requires proving for the computed result that:
 1. It is less than or equal to both a and b (that is, (result ≤ a ∧ result ≤ b)); and 
 2. It is equal to either a or b (that is, (result = a ∨ result = b)).

Our overall idea is sound; what does not match is the way we are “constructing” the conjuncts. Instead of supplying three bullet points after “constructor”, we need exactly two groups—one for the left part and one for the right part.

───────────────────────────── 
Step 4. Identify Any Type Mismatches or Incorrect Assumptions

Looking carefully at the first branch, we see that we used:
 · apply h             -- (intended for a ≤ b)
 · apply Int.le_trans h      -- but this is not the correct way to get a ≤ a; we should simply use le_refl.
 · left; rfl            -- shows a equals a.

In the second branch, we used a similar structure:
 · apply le_of_not_le h   -- but the theorem le_of_not_le is not even the right type here (one must show that b ≤ a, which follows from b < a since ¬(a ≤ b) implies a > b);
 · apply le_refl       -- that gives b ≤ b,
 · right; rfl          -- shows b equals b.

Thus there is a type mismatch in the ordering part of each branch. In the first branch, we needed to prove a ≤ a (by le_refl) and a ≤ b (by h) rather than “Int.le_trans h”. In the second branch, we must prove b ≤ a by using the fact that ¬(a ≤ b) gives a > b.

───────────────────────────── 
Step 5. Consider Alternative Proof Strategies

A better approach is to “split” the goal into its two conjuncts. For example, after “by_cases h : a <= b” you could use a structure like this:

Case 1 (when h is true):
 • Since myMin a b simplifies to a, prove:
  – (a ≤ a) ∧ (a ≤ b) by exactly:
   – a ≤ a is by le_refl,
   – a ≤ b is h.
 • Also prove:
  – a = a ∨ a = b by choosing the “left” side (since a = a by rfl).

Case 2 (when h is false):
 • Since myMin a b simplifies to b, prove:
  – (b ≤ a) ∧ (b ≤ b) where b ≤ a is obtained by noticing that ¬(a ≤ b) implies a > b (so use, for example, Int.lt_of_not_le h together with Int.le_of_lt),
   – and b ≤ b is by le_refl.
 • Also prove:
  – b = a ∨ b = b by choosing the “right” side (b = b by rfl).

One way to fix the proof is to eliminate the extra bullet (·) levels and supply exactly two major subgoals in each case.

───────────────────────────── 
Detailed Analysis of the Root Cause and Directions for Fixing It

The root cause is that our bullet lists did not match the structure of the goal. We used three bullet commands after “constructor” even though our goal is simply an ∧ of two sub-goals. Moreover, in the “ordering” part we misapplied the lemmas: in the “if” branch we need to show a ≤ a (use le_refl) together with a ≤ b (given by h) and in the “else” branch we need to show b ≤ a (obtained from a > b) along with b ≤ b (by le_refl). Finally, the “unexpected token '·'” error is due to the bullet notation being used in the wrong place (or extra bullets being present).

To fix it, one should rewrite the proof so that in each by‐case branch there are exactly two subgoals (one for the ordering conjunct and one for the equality conjunct) and then use the correct lemmas for each; for example:

 -- for the branch when a ≤ b:
 apply And.intro, then prove
  • show a ≤ a by exact le_refl,
  • show a ≤ b by exact h,
 and then prove a = a ∨ a = b by picking “or.inl rfl”.

 -- in the branch when ¬ (a ≤ b):
 apply And.intro, then prove
  • show b ≤ a by using the fact that ¬(a ≤ b) gives a > b (for example, using Int.lt_of_not_le h and then Int.le_of_lt),
  • show b ≤ b using le_refl,
 and prove b = a ∨ b = b by picking “or.inr rfl”.

In short, the structure of the proof must be corrected so that:
 • our bullet levels correspond exactly to the two parts of our ∧,
 • we use the proper lemmas for proving reflexivity or ordering (such as le_refl, not Int.le_trans), and
 • we do not supply extra bullet (·) lines that leave subgoals unsolved.

───────────────────────────── 
Conclusion

The error comes from misusing the bullet syntax and not matching the conjunctive structure required by myMin_spec. We tried to supply three subproofs (one for each bullet) when only two are needed, and we used the wrong lemmas in the ordering parts (for example, using Int.le_trans on h rather than le_refl and an appropriate argument from the ordering when ¬(a ≤ b)).

A good way to proceed is to rewrite the proof using split or constructor so that you clearly prove exactly the two conjuncts needed and then use the correct properties for each case. This will solve both the “unsolved goals” and the “unexpected token '·'” errors.

A corrected version might look like this (using tactic language instead of bullet notation):

----------------------------------------------------------------
theorem myMin_spec_satisfied (a b : Int) :
  myMin_spec a b (myMin a b) := by
  unfold myMin myMin_spec
  by_cases h : a ≤ b
  · -- case when a ≤ b, so myMin a b = a
    apply And.intro
    · -- show a ≤ a ∧ a ≤ b
      exact And.intro (le_refl a) h
    · -- show (a = a ∨ a = b) 
      exact Or.inl rfl
  · -- case when ¬(a ≤ b), so myMin a b = b
    apply And.intro
    · -- show b ≤ a ∧ b ≤ b.
      -- Since ¬(a ≤ b) implies a > b, we have b < a, so b ≤ a
      have lt_ab : b < a := Int.lt_of_not_le h
      exact And.intro (Int.le_of_lt lt_ab) (le_refl b)
    · -- show (b = a ∨ b = b)
      exact Or.inr rfl
----------------------------------------------------------------

This revised proof matches the specification exactly and avoids the bullet – and type – errors.
  
In summary, the root cause is a mis–structured proof (using too many bullet levels and the wrong lemmas) rather than an error in the definitions, and fixing the tactic bullet structure and correcting the inequalities will resolve the error.
