We’ll see that nothing is “wrong” with the high‐level idea—the statement is indeed trying to show that the Bool computed by hasOppositeSign matches (is equivalent to) the “logical” condition written in hasOppositeSign_spec. Instead, the error comes from the way the proof script “deconstructs” the disjunction and uses the anonymous pairing notation. Let’s break down what is happening step‐by‐step.

────────────────────────────
1. Identifying the failing tactic

In the proof you write

  cases h with
  | inl h1 => exact Or.inl ⟨h1, by linarith⟩
  | inr h2 => exact Or.inr ⟨h2, by linarith⟩

The error message complains both about “invalid constructor ⟨...⟩” and “invalid alternative name ‘inl’”. That tells us that the tactic which is “cases h with …” does not accept the alternative names “inl” and “inr” (or, equivalently, the use of the anonymous constructor ⟨ … ⟩ does not match an inductive type as Lean expects).

────────────────────────────
2. The proof state at that point

After the “unfold” step the goal is to prove an equivalence
  ((a < 0 ∧ b > 0) ∨ (a > 0 ∧ b < 0)) ↔ (hasOppositeSign a b)
where the right‐hand side is a Bool. (There is an extra “coercion” issue because Bool and Prop are different realms, but for this discussion we assume the intended conversion is available.) When you do “intro h” in the first branch you are assuming h is a proof of the left side of the equivalence. In order to prove the “→” direction you then want to case‐analyze h, which has type
  (a < 0 ∧ b > 0) ∨ (a > 0 ∧ b < 0).

Standard Lean definitions for “or” are usually given by an inductive type with constructors named Or.inl and Or.inr. (The syntax “inl” is understood in Lean3 but in Lean4 the alternatives must usually be written either as “Or.inl”/“Or.inr” or by using “rcases”.)

────────────────────────────
3. Matching the proof approach with the specification

Your intended strategy is to split the equivalence into two implications (using constructor on “↔”) and then, in the first implication, analyze the disjunction to rebuild a proof of the boolean value (by using Or.inl or Or.inr along with an “⟨…, …⟩” that pairs the two parts of the “and”). That is sound. (There is also a more conceptual issue that one is equating a Boolean and a Prop, but let’s assume that’s handled by a suitable coercion or by design.)

────────────────────────────
4. Looking for type mismatches or incorrect assumptions

Two issues appear:

• In the “cases h with” line you use “| inl h1 => …”. In Lean4 you must either use the full names “Or.inl h1” or use a pattern‑matching form that doesn’t expect “inl” as an alternative name. (Lean4’s new pattern-matching syntax for inductive types requires that the constructor names are those defined in the inductive type declaration.) In other words the alternative “inl” is not recognized. (Similarly for “inr”.)

• The anonymous constructor notation “⟨h1, by linarith⟩” is intended to build a proof of an “and” proposition (using the And.intro constructor) but the error “invalid constructor ⟨ ... ⟩” tells us that either Lean cannot determine the expected inductive type or the goal isn’t exactly an “and” though you intended it to be. (Sometimes this happens when a coercion from Bool to Prop is involved.) One fix is to explicitly use “And.intro h1 (by linarith)” so that Lean knows which inductive constructor you mean.

────────────────────────────
5. Considering alternative proof strategies

A common alternative is to use the “rcases” tactic in Lean 4 instead of “cases”. For example, you might write:

  rcases h with (⟨h1, _⟩ | ⟨h2, _⟩)

so that Lean automatically breaks h into the two cases. (You will likely want to fill in the second component by a proof such as “by linarith”.) Also, instead of writing “Or.inl ⟨ … ⟩” you might write something like

  exact Or.inl (And.intro h1 (by linarith))

so that the pairing is explicit via And.intro.

────────────────────────────
Detailed Root Cause and Suggested Direction for Fix

The root cause is that the pattern-matching syntax used in your “cases h with” is not valid in Lean 4. The alternatives you wrote (“| inl h1” and “| inr h2”) do not match the constructors of the inductively defined “or” (which are Or.inl and Or.inr). Also, the anonymous pairing notation “⟨ … ⟩” runs into a type inference issue (likely because of the mix between Bool versus Prop or because Lean cannot see the expected inductive “and”).

Thus, there are two types of fixes:
  (1) Change the pattern matching to either use full names (for example, “or.inl h1” instead of “inl h1”) or use rcases.
  (2) Replace the pairing “⟨h1, by linarith⟩” with an explicit introduction “And.intro h1 (by linarith)” so that Lean can correctly infer the type.

A revised version of the problematic block might be:

  · intro h
    rcases h with (h1 | h2)
    · exact Or.inl (And.intro h1 (by linarith))
    · exact Or.inr (And.intro h2 (by linarith))

(or, if you prefer using cases, write “cases h with | Or.inl h1 => … | Or.inr h2 => …”).

In summary, the error is not an error in the high-level proof idea but in the Lean 4 tactics syntax. Changing the pattern alternatives to use properly scoped names and replacing the anonymous pairing with an explicit constructor should resolve the problem.

A good direction for fixing is to read the Lean 4 documentation on pattern matching (and the “rcases” tactic) to learn the new alternative syntax for disjunctions, and to check that you are producing the right inductive constructor (using And.intro) when you build a pair.
