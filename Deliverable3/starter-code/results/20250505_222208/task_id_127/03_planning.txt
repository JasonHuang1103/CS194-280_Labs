Below is our step‐by‐step reasoning and plan.

──────────────────────────────
1. Understanding the Task:

• We are given a Lean 4 template that asks for two things:
  – A function multiply that takes two integers (of type Int) and returns their product.
  – A theorem (multiply_spec_satisfied) proving that the result returned by multiply is equal to a * b.
  
• In our multiply_spec, the specification is simply that the result should equal a * b.
  
──────────────────────────────
2. Breaking Down the Problem:

• Implementation Subproblem:
  – We need to implement the multiply function. Since Lean (and Mathlib) already defines multiplication on the Int type, the simplest way is to return a * b.

• Proof Subproblem:
  – The theorem multiply_spec_satisfied expects us to prove: multiply_spec a b (multiply a b) holds.
  – After unfolding the definitions, the goal becomes:
  
       (multiply a b) = a * b
  
    But multiply was defined as a * b; hence the goal becomes:
  
       a * b = a * b
  
  – This is an immediate equality (reflexivity) and can be closed with the tactic rfl.

──────────────────────────────
3. Considering Input Types & Edge Cases:

• As both inputs are integers (Int), there is no special case because the built-in multiplication operation on integers correctly handles negative values, zero, and positive values.
  
• Thus, no extra edge case handling is necessary.

──────────────────────────────
4. Proof Techniques:

• The proof consists of unfolding the definitions of both multiply and multiply_spec so that the goal becomes a trivial reflexive equality.
  
• The tactic rfl (short for “reflexivity”) can then solve the goal because by definition a * b equals a * b.

──────────────────────────────
5. Similar Patterns from Examples:

• In many Lean examples (and as shown in the documentation snippets) one proves that an expression equals itself by using “rfl.”
  
• The provided template instructs us to “unfold multiply multiply_spec” then fill in the proof. Once unfolded, our goal simplifies to a * b = a * b.

──────────────────────────────
6. Detailed Plan for Implementation and Proof:

Step-by-Step Plan:

A. Implementation:
   – Define multiply as follows:
     def multiply (a : Int) (b : Int) : Int := a * b

B. Specification:
   – The specification is already defined: multiply_spec asserts that the result equals a * b.

C. Proof:
   – In theorem multiply_spec_satisfied, first ‘unfold’ the definitions of multiply and multiply_spec.
   – After unfolding, the goal becomes: a * b = a * b.
   – Apply rfl (reflexivity) to conclude the proof.

──────────────────────────────
7. Final Lean 4 Code Outline:

The final Lean file will be as follows:

------------------------------------------------
import Mathlib
import Aesop

-- Implementation
def multiply (a : Int) (b : Int) : Int :=
  -- << CODE START >>
  a * b
  -- << CODE END >>

-- Theorem: The result should be the product of the two input integers
def multiply_spec (a : Int) (b : Int) (result : Int) : Prop :=
  -- << SPEC START >>
  result = a * b
  -- << SPEC END >>

theorem multiply_spec_satisfied (a : Int) (b : Int) :
  multiply_spec a b (multiply a b) := by
  -- << PROOF START >>
  unfold multiply multiply_spec,
  rfl
  -- << PROOF END >>
------------------------------------------------

──────────────────────────────
Conclusion:

The plan is to implement the multiply function using the built-in multiplication operator and then prove by unfolding the definitions that the answer equals a * b. The proof is trivial by reflexivity. This matches the pattern seen in the Lean examples where unfolding and application of rfl closes the goal.

This completes our step-by-step plan.
