We want to prove

  ¬ (p ↔ ¬p)

that is, show that the bi‐implication “p if and only if ¬p” leads to a contradiction. (Remember that in Lean notation, “¬A” means “A → False”.)

A typical “classical” proof would go like this:
1. Assume h : (p ↔ ¬p). (That is, h is a pair of functions:
  • h.mp : p → ¬p  
  • h.mpr : ¬p → p.)
2. Then “suppose p holds.” In that case h.mp would yield ¬p and so we’d have both p and ¬p (i.e. a contradiction).
3. On the other hand, if “suppose ¬p holds,” then h.mpr would give p and again we’d get a contradiction.
4. Conclude that either way “p ∨ ¬p” (the law of excluded middle) gives a contradiction.

In words, by “splitting on p” you show that whether p holds or not, h leads to a contradiction; hence h cannot exist.

But here is where the error appears when one tries to do the proof “without using classical logic” (that is, without using any form of the law of excluded middle): 

─────────────────────────────────────────────  
Step 1. Which tactic is “failing” and why? 

Often the first tactic that “fails” is one that tries to do a case analysis on p. For example, one might write

  cases (em p) with hp hnp

or even try

  by_cases hp : p

to “split” the situation. In Lean’s constructive (intuitionistic) logic, the law of excluded middle “em p” is not available by default. (That is, you cannot prove “p ∨ ¬p” for an arbitrary proposition p without extra axioms.) In our attempted proof, the tactic that “splits” on p is not justified unless you add classical reasoning.

─────────────────────────────────────────────  
Step 2. Consider the proof state at that point

At the moment you assume h : (p ↔ ¬p) and then try either
  have hp : p,  or  have hnp : ¬p,
you find yourself stuck. The context contains the two functions  
  h.mp : p → ¬p  and  h.mpr : ¬p → p  
but without a way to “choose” or “decide” between p and ¬p you cannot produce a concrete term of type p or ¬p. In other words, the goal is “False,” and the only way to reach False would be to eventually produce both p and ¬p—but you can’t get either because you don’t have the law of excluded middle in constructive logic.

─────────────────────────────────────────────  
Step 3. Does the proof approach match the specification?

The intended specification is to show that (p ↔ ¬p) leads to contradiction. The classical proof is “by cases on p,” but that reasoning uses a case split “p ∨ ¬p” (i.e. the law of excluded middle). In intuitionistic logic the equivalence “p ↔ ¬p” is not necessarily contradictory unless one additionally assumes that p is decidable. In other words, note that
  ¬(p ↔ ¬p)
is classically valid but is not provable constructively for an arbitrary proposition p.

─────────────────────────────────────────────  
Step 4. Identify any type mismatches or incorrect assumptions

The “mismatch” is not so much a Lean type error (like feeding a term of one type where another is expected), but rather that the overall proof strategy tries to “split on p” even though there is no term of type “p ∨ ¬p” available in the current (constructive) context. The tactics that would “choose” one branch or the other (for example, by invoking “classical.em p” or “by_cases p”) require the classical law of excluded middle. Without it the assumptions h.mp and h.mpr are not enough to construct a term of type False.

─────────────────────────────────────────────  
Step 5. Alternative proof strategies

In order to prove ¬ (p ↔ ¬p) one almost always needs some form of classical reasoning. For example, one could add

  open Classical

to bring the law of excluded middle into play and then either use “by_cases” or “em p” to split on the truth value of p. Alternatively, if you wish to remain constructive you must either assume an extra hypothesis (such as “Decidable p”) or you must change the statement (perhaps restricting to propositions for which p ∨ ¬p is known to hold). Without such an assumption, the statement itself is not constructively provable.

─────────────────────────────────────────────  
Conclusion and Root Cause Analysis

The root cause of the “error” is that the proof attempt tries to use a case analysis on p (or otherwise extract an element of p or ¬p) without having a constructive proof of p ∨ ¬p. In intuitionistic logic (which Lean uses by default) the law of excluded middle is not available, so the usual “classical” proof of ¬(p ↔ ¬p) does not go through. In other words, the proposition ¬(p ↔ ¬p) is classically true but not provable in pure (constructive) Lean without appealing to the classical axioms. 

A suggested direction for fixing the problem is either to:

 • Add “open Classical” (or an explicit use of “em p” or “by_cases”) so that the proof can perform the necessary case split on p
 • Or assume that p is decidable (for example, by including a hypothesis in the theorem), thus allowing one to obtain p ∨ ¬p constructively.

Without one of these changes, the current proof approach is bound to “fail” because it attempts to use reasoning (splitting on p) that is not available in constructive logic.

─────────────────────────────────────────────  
Summary

1. The failing tactic is one that “splits” on p (e.g. by_cases or using em p) because in pure Lean (without classical reasoning) you cannot obtain p ∨ ¬p.
2. At that point in the proof, the context contains h : p ↔ ¬p but no information that lets you choose either p or ¬p.
3. The proof approach matches the classical specification but not the “without classical logic” specification.
4. There is no type error in the usual sense—but there is an “incorrect assumption” in that the proof implicitly assumes the law of excluded middle.
5. To fix it you must either work in a classical setting (by opening Classical) or add an assumption that p is decidable.

That is the detailed analysis of the error and the reasoning steps leading to the conclusion.
