We need to write a function that returns true exactly when n is divisible by 11—that is, when n % 11 yields 0—and then prove that the returned Boolean “captures” the proposition (n % 11 = 0).

Let’s go through our reasoning step-by-step:

───────────────────────────── Step 1: Understanding the Problem

• The objective is to define a function isDivisibleBy11 : Int → Bool so that for any integer n, the function returns true exactly when n mod 11 equals 0.
• In Lean, the notation “n % 11” computes the remainder upon division by 11.
• The specification is stated by the predicate isDivisibleBy11_spec n result, which is defined to mean that “n % 11 = 0 ↔ result”.
• In other words, our Boolean result must “decide” the proposition n % 11 = 0.

───────────────────────────── Step 2: Breaking Down the Problem

(a) Implementation Subproblem:
  – We need to produce a Boolean from the integer computation – that is, decide whether n % 11 = 0.
  – One very straightforward way is to use a conditional: “if n % 11 = 0 then true else false.”
  – (Alternatively you could use the “==” operator if the decidable equality is set up for Int. However, using the if-then-else is more explicit and works perfectly.)

(b) Proof Subproblem:
  – The theorem isDivisibleBy11_spec_satisfied must show that isDivisibleBy11_spec n (isDivisibleBy11 n) holds.
  – After unfolding the definitions, the goal will be to prove that:
    
       (n % 11 = 0) ↔ (if n % 11 = 0 then true else false)
    
  – We can prove this by a case analysis on the condition “n % 11 = 0.” (In Lean you can automatically split such if–then–else definitions with the tactic split_ifs.)
  – In the case when n % 11 = 0 holds, the conditional returns true and the equivalence becomes “(n % 11 = 0) ↔ true” which is true since we already assumed the left side.
  – In the opposite case, when n % 11 ≠ 0, the conditional returns false so the equivalence becomes “(n % 11 = 0) ↔ false.” This clearly holds because by assumption the left side is false.
  – Thus, a “split_ifs” tactic will do the work for us after we “unfold” our definitions.

───────────────────────────── Step 3: Input Types, Edge Cases, and Expected Behavior

• Our input is an integer (Int) in Lean. The modulo operation “n % 11” is defined for negative numbers as well, so our definition will handle all cases.
• Edge cases include n = 0 (divisible by every integer except 0) and negative numbers. Our definition works uniformly because it directly tests the condition n % 11 = 0.

───────────────────────────── Step 4: Proof Techniques

• For the proof we plan to use:
  – Unfolding definitions “unfold isDivisibleBy11 isDivisibleBy11_spec”
  – The “split_ifs” tactic to split the conditional provided by the function.
  – “simp” or “rfl” to close the remaining trivial equivalences in each branch.
• This is a typical case analysis proof that mirrors how one would “compute” with an if–then–else.

───────────────────────────── Step 5: Similar Patterns from Examples

• In the provided documentation there are many examples of using split_ifs and case splitting for functions defined by if–then–else.
• The technique is similar to the “tauto” examples: break the goal into cases (the “if” branch and the “else” branch) and then solve each side of the equivalence.
• This pattern is standard in Lean for decision procedures or functions that “decide” a given property.

───────────────────────────── Final Detailed Plan

1. Implementation:
   • Define isDivisibleBy11 by writing:
   
       def isDivisibleBy11 (n : Int) : Bool :=
         if n % 11 = 0 then true else false

   • (This function checks the condition “n % 11 = 0” and returns true when it holds.)

2. Proof:
   • Write the theorem isDivisibleBy11_spec_satisfied which states that

         isDivisibleBy11_spec n (isDivisibleBy11 n)
    
     unfolds to “n % 11 = 0 ↔ (if n % 11 = 0 then true else false)”.
     
   • In the proof script, first “unfold” the definitions.
   • Use the tactic “split_ifs” to separate the two branches.
   • In the first branch (when n % 11 = 0), the goal becomes “n % 11 = 0 ↔ true”; this is immediately solved (by simp or reflexivity) because under the assumption the statement is true.
   • In the second branch (when n % 11 ≠ 0), the goal becomes “n % 11 = 0 ↔ false.” Again, this holds by definition since the left-hand side is false.
   • Close the proof in each branch by a simple “rfl” or “simp.”

───────────────────────────── Sample Final Lean Code

Below is the complete design in Lean 4:

---------------------------------------------------
import Mathlib
import Aesop

-- Implementation
def isDivisibleBy11 (n : Int) : Bool :=
  if n % 11 = 0 then true else false

-- Theorem specification: The result is true if and only if n is divisible by 11
def isDivisibleBy11_spec (n : Int) (result : Bool) : Prop :=
  n % 11 = 0 ↔ result

-- Theorem proving that our implementation satisfies the spec
theorem isDivisibleBy11_spec_satisfied (n : Int) :
  isDivisibleBy11_spec n (isDivisibleBy11 n) := by
  unfold isDivisibleBy11 isDivisibleBy11_spec
  split_ifs
  · -- branch where n % 11 = 0 holds, so we need to show: n % 11 = 0 ↔ true
    simp
  · -- branch where n % 11 ≠ 0 holds, so we need to show: n % 11 = 0 ↔ false
    simp

---------------------------------------------------

This plan meets the requirements:
• The function returns true exactly when n is divisible by 11.
• The proof breaks down the if–then–else into cases and shows the required equivalence.

You can now implement the above code in Lean 4.
