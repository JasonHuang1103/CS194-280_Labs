Below is one way to explain the problem step‐by‐step.

──────────────────────────────
1. Identify which tactic is failing and why

The error occurs on the line

  exact Iff.refl _

Here Lean complains “unexpected identifier; expected command.” In other words, the tactic “exact Iff.refl _” (with an underscore as an argument) is not being accepted. In Lean 4 you cannot use an underscore here as a “hole” for the argument expected by Iff.refl. (In earlier versions or in some contexts an underscore might be tolerated, but here Lean 4’s parser finds it an unexpected identifier.)

──────────────────────────────
2. Consider the proof state at that point

Before the failing line the proof does

  unfold isDivisibleBy11 isDivisibleBy11_spec  
  simp

After unfolding the definitions, the goal becomes: 

  n % 11 = 0 ↔ (if n % 11 = 0 then true else false)

The simp step simplifies the right-hand side so that the goal essentially becomes:

  n % 11 = 0 ↔ n % 11 = 0

This is a reflexivity statement that can be proved by Iff.refl. (Since any statement “A ↔ A” is true by reflexivity.) Thus the natural idea is to use exactly “Iff.refl” to close the goal.

──────────────────────────────
3. Check if the proof approach matches the specification

The approach is correct: we want to show that the Boolean (if n % 11 = 0 then true else false) is exactly equal to the proposition (n % 11 = 0) in the specification, after unfolding the definitions. After simp we are left with an identity that should be solved by reflexivity (Iff.refl). So the overall method is fine. The issue is only with the technical use of “exact Iff.refl _”.

──────────────────────────────
4. Identify any type mismatches or incorrect assumptions

The error is not about a type mismatch in the mathematical argument. Instead, it is a syntactical issue. Iff.refl expects its argument to be provided explicitly (or it can sometimes infer it when the goal is exactly “A ↔ A”). Writing “Iff.refl _” uses an underscore as a placeholder, but Lean 4 does not accept an underscore in that tactic application. (The underscore is not recognized as a “hole” in that position.) 

Thus the “exact Iff.refl _” is syntactically wrong. In addition, nothing in the unfolding is wrong from the specification point of view: we want to prove that

  n % 11 = 0 ↔ (if n % 11 = 0 then true else false)

which is exactly what follows from definition unfolding.

──────────────────────────────
5. Consider alternative proof strategies

There are two simple ways to repair this:

• Remove the underscore and just write
  exact Iff.refl
since Lean’s type‐inference will see that you mean the reflexivity of “n % 11 = 0 ↔ n % 11 = 0.”

• Alternatively, you can give the explicit term by writing
  exact Iff.refl (n % 11 = 0)
(if necessary).

Either way, the point is that you must not leave an underscore at that position.

──────────────────────────────
Conclusion & Suggested Fix

The root cause of the error is that the tactic “exact Iff.refl _” is not acceptable in Lean 4—the underscore is parsed as an unexpected identifier. Lean expects the term that shows “A ↔ A,” but the placeholder “_” is not allowed here. To fix the error, remove the underscore and write either:

  exact Iff.refl

or provide the full argument explicitly. This change respects the tactic syntax in Lean 4 and will allow the proof to compile.
