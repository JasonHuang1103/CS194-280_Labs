Below is a step-by-step analysis of the error and suggestions for fixing it.

─────────────────────────────  
Step 1. Identify the specific part of the code causing the error  
─────────────────────────────  
The error message is:  
  error: unknown constant 'Int.min'  
This tells us that the constant Int.min—used in the definition of minOfThree—is not recognized in the current context. In the code, this appears on the line  
  Int.min a (Int.min b c)  
inside the function minOfThree.

─────────────────────────────  
Step 2. Explain why this is causing an issue  
─────────────────────────────  
Lean cannot find any declaration for Int.min. This means that either the function does not exist in the current standard library context or it is defined somewhere else (perhaps with a different name or in another module). When Lean sees Int.min, it tries to look it up, and since it is not declared or imported from any module, it raises an error.

─────────────────────────────  
Step 3. Consider the type system and Lean 4 requirements  
─────────────────────────────  
In Lean 4, constants and functions must be defined or imported explicitly before they can be used. Although the Int type is built into Lean, helper functions like min for integers might not be provided under the name Int.min. In Lean’s Mathlib or core libraries, functions performing a “minimum” operation for comparable types are often defined generically (or as different names). Thus, having a direct call to Int.min is not accepted because:
 • The constant is not in the prelude.
 • The intended operation (computing the minimum of two integers) must either be defined manually or imported from a module that provides it.
  
─────────────────────────────  
Step 4. Think through potential solutions  
─────────────────────────────  
There are at least two ways to address this issue:

1. Import the correct module that declares the “min” function for integers.  
  • Sometimes, you might need to import from the standard library or Mathlib. Check if a module (e.g., Std or Lean’s library) provides min for Int.  
  • You may need to open a namespace that contains min. For example, if there is Std.Data.Int, one might write:  
   import Std.Data.Int  
   open Std

2. Define the min function yourself using an if–then–else expression.  
  For example, you could write:
   def myIntMin (x y : Int) : Int :=
     if x ≤ y then x else y  
  Then use myIntMin in your definition of minOfThree:
   def minOfThree (a b c : Int) : Int :=
     myIntMin a (myIntMin b c)

─────────────────────────────  
Step 5. Consider how similar examples handle this situation  
─────────────────────────────  
In similar examples or tutorials, operations for taking a minimum are either provided via a standard function (like Nat.min for natural numbers) or constructed via if–then–else expressions. For instance, when people want to compute the minimum of two integers but lean cannot find a predefined function, they often define their own helper:
  def intMin (x y : Int) : Int :=
    if x ≤ y then x else y  
Using a helper function also has the benefit of making the code more explicit and understandable. Also, importing the necessary module (if one exists) is common practice when you want to use predefined functions.

─────────────────────────────  
Conclusion and Specific Suggestions for Fixing the Implementation  
─────────────────────────────  

Option 1: Import the appropriate module (if available)  
 • Search for and import the module that defines the integer minimum. For example, if Mathlib (or the Std library) defines it, you might need:  
  import Std.Data.Int  
  open Std  
 • Then, if the function is indeed named min there, you could change Int.min to simply min (or keep the namespaced version if needed).

Option 2: Define your own helper function  
Replace the use of Int.min with a custom definition. For example:

------------------------------------------------
import Mathlib
import Aesop

def intMin (x y : Int) : Int :=
  if x ≤ y then x else y

def minOfThree (a b c : Int) : Int :=
  intMin a (intMin b c)

def minOfThree_spec (a : Int) (b : Int) (c : Int) (result : Int) : Prop :=
  (result ≤ a ∧ result ≤ b ∧ result ≤ c) ∧
  (result = a ∨ result = b ∨ result = c)

theorem minOfThree_spec_satisfied (a : Int) (b : Int) (c : Int) :
  minOfThree_spec a b c (minOfThree a b c) := by
  unfold minOfThree minOfThree_spec
  sorry
------------------------------------------------

This solution removes the error because you no longer try to use an undefined constant.

By following one of these suggestions—either importing the necessary module or defining the needed helper function—you resolve the unknown constant error and conform to Lean 4's requirements.
