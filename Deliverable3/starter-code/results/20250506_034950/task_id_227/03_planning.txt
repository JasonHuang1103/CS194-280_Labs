Below is one way to approach the problem. We start by noting that the function must return the smallest of three integers and that the returned value must be one of the given inputs. One standard way of doing this is either to “nest” the built‐in minimum function (for instance, using Int.min) or to do a case split with if–then–else. In our plan we use the Int.min function from mathlib, writing

  minOfThree a b c = Int.min a (Int.min b c).

This definition is brief and uses the already available properties of Int.min.

Let’s step through our reasoning, and then we present the complete plan for both implementation and proof.

────────────────────────
Step 1. Understanding the Function Specification

• The function minOfThree is to take three integers (a, b, c) and return an integer.
• The returned integer must satisfy:
  (1) It is less than or equal to a, b, and c.
  (2) It is equal to one of a, b, or c.

────────────────────────
Step 2. Breaking the Problem into Subproblems

• Compute the minimum of three integers. One straightforward method is to compute the minimum of b and c first and then compare that to a. That is, write
  minOfThree a b c = Int.min a (Int.min b c).
• This neatly covers the “less than or equal” part because there are standard lemmas
  Int.min_le_left and Int.min_le_right
 that establish that the “min” is less than or equal to each argument.
• For showing that the result is one of the inputs, note that the definition of Int.min is typically given by
  if x ≤ y then x else y.
 Thus, when we compute Int.min a (Int.min b c), there are two cases:
  – If a ≤ Int.min b c then the result is a.
  – Otherwise, the result is (Int.min b c) and we must further check that this is either b or c (by case splitting on Int.min b c).

────────────────────────
Step 3. Consider Input Types, Edge Cases, and Expected Behavior

• The inputs are of type Int, so they can be positive, negative, or equal.
• If two or all numbers are equal, using the standard min function still guarantees that one of them is returned.
• There is no hidden behavior, so our implementation must work uniformly across all integers.

────────────────────────
Step 4. Proof Techniques

For the proof that the function meets the specification we must show two things:
 (1) The result is less than or equal to a, b, c.
 (2) The result is equal to one of {a, b, c}.

A suitable proof technique is to “unfold” the definition of minOfThree (and hence Int.min) and then do case analysis on the if–then–else statements. The tactic split_ifs makes this easy. For the inequalities, we can use linear arithmetic (for instance, the linarith tactic) to tie together the assumptions coming from the if–then–else splits.

────────────────────────
Step 5. Similar Patterns from Lean Examples

The examples noted in the description show that one can typically do something like

  split_ifs with h1, h2
   { … },
   { … }

and then use linarith or similar tactics to close inequality subgoals. We plan to follow this pattern by splitting first on the condition for computing the outer min and then on the inner one.

────────────────────────
Detailed Plan

1. Implementation

Define minOfThree using the built‐in Int.min function:
  def minOfThree (a : Int) (b : Int) (c : Int) : Int :=
   Int.min a (Int.min b c)

2. Specification

We already have the specification in the template as:
  def minOfThree_spec (a : Int) (b : Int) (c : Int) (result : Int) : Prop :=
   (result ≤ a ∧ result ≤ b ∧ result ≤ c) ∧ (result = a ∨ result = b ∨ result = c)

3. Proof

To prove theorem minOfThree_spec_satisfied (a b c : Int) : minOfThree_spec a b c (minOfThree a b c), we do:

• Unfold the definitions of minOfThree and minOfThree_spec.
• Use split_ifs to handle the two levels of if–then–else induced by Int.min.
  – Case 1: If a ≤ Int.min b c, then the function returns a. Then
   • a ≤ a is trivial.
   • a ≤ b and a ≤ c follow from the fact that a ≤ Int.min b c and the definition of Int.min.
   • The “or” part of the specification is satisfied since the result is equal to a.
  – Case 2: Otherwise, the function returns Int.min b c. We now use split_ifs on the inner if–then–else that defines Int.min b c:
   • If b ≤ c then the result is b. The necessary inequalities hold by properties of Int.min.
   • Otherwise, the result is c.
• Use linarith or direct derivations to close the inequality subgoals.

Explanation

1. We use "split_ifs" in the theorem proof to reflect the if–then–else structure in our definition. In the first branch, we assume a ≤ Int.min b c and hence result = a. We then show a is less than or equal to a, b, and c (using the fact that Int.min b c ≤ b and Int.min b c ≤ c). The disjunction (result = a ∨ result = b ∨ result = c) holds because result = a.

2. In the second branch, when a is not less than or equal to Int.min b c, the result becomes Int.min b c. We then split again on whether b ≤ c holds:
  – When b ≤ c, result = b.
  – Otherwise, result = c.
 In both subcases the inequalities follow by the properties of the min function, and the result is clearly one of the inputs.

3. We use linarith or direct rewriting (here, we use simple rewriting and le_refl) to close some of the inequality subgoals.

────────────────────────
Conclusion

The plan uses the built‐in minimum function and then relies on case analysis of if–then–else expressions to show that the result meets the specification. The tactics split_ifs and linarith (or direct rewriting) complete the proof of the specification.

This detailed plan addresses both the implementation and the proof aspects of the task.
