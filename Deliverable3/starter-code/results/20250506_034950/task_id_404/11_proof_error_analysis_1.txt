Below is an explanation of what went wrong with the proof along with a discussion of each step in the analysis.

─────────────────────────────  
1. Identifying the Failing Tactic

The error message mentions “unsolved goals” and then shows two “cases” (one for a branch with h : a ≤ b and one with h : ¬ a ≤ b). In the proof we see the tactic

  split_ifs  
  case pos (h : a ≤ b) => …  
  case neg (h : ¬ a ≤ b) => …

In Lean 4 the tactic “split_ifs” is meant to remove an if–then–else construct by doing a case analysis on the condition. However, the way the cases are written (“case pos …” and “case neg …”) is not recognized as proper tactic syntax after split_ifs. In other words, Lean does not expect named “case pos” or “case neg” blocks in this situation. This is why after the “split_ifs” Lean reports unsolved goals and even complains “unexpected identifier; expected command”.

─────────────────────────────  
2. Considering the Proof State at That Point

After the “unfold myMin myMin_spec”, the goal becomes an expression that still has an if–then–else (because myMin is defined that way). Then “split_ifs” is supposed to perform the case analysis on the condition (i.e. a ≤ b or its negation). Normally, split_ifs produces one goal for each branch. In our case the expected branches are:
 • one with the hypothesis h : a ≤ b and a goal stating
  (a ≤ a ∧ a ≤ b) ∧ (a = a ∨ a = b)  
 • one with h : ¬ a ≤ b and a corresponding goal.  
What happens instead is that the “split_ifs” invocation and the subsequent “case pos”/“case neg” blocks are not structurally stitched together into a complete proof. The “case” annotations are not interpreted as part of the split_ifs elimination. Hence the goals remain unsolved.

─────────────────────────────  
3. Matching the Proof Approach with the Specification

The overall idea behind the proof is perfectly natural:
 – Unfold the definitions.
 – Do a case split based on whether a ≤ b holds.
 – In the “then” branch, show that the result (which is a) satisfies the spec.
 – In the “else” branch, do the same with the other possibility.
The specification “myMin_spec” requires proving both that the computed result is less than or equal to a and b and that it equals either a or b. In each branch the use of constructor and bullet proofs is reasonable. The error therefore is not a matter of the “mathematical” approach but of the tactic syntax and structure.

─────────────────────────────  
4. Identifying Type Mismatches or Incorrect Assumptions

There are two details to check:
 (a) In the “then” branch the proof uses “exact ⟨le_refl a, h⟩” for showing a ≤ a ∧ a ≤ b. This is perfectly fine.
 (b) In the “else” branch, the proof uses “Int.le_of_lt (by have h' : b < a := Int.lt_of_not_ge h; exact h')” to obtain b ≤ a. (In Lean’s library the relevant theorems are available and the idea is acceptable provided one is working in classical logic.)  
Thus there is no intrinsic type mismatch or false assumption in the content of the proof; the problem lies instead with the way the case analysis is structured.

─────────────────────────────  
5. Considering Alternative Proof Strategies

A couple of alternative approaches would fix the problem:

• Use “by_cases” instead of “split_ifs” with a proper “if h : a ≤ b then … else …” structure. For example:
 
 theorem myMin_spec_satisfied (a b : Int) : myMin_spec a b (myMin a b) := by
   unfold myMin myMin_spec
   by_cases h : a ≤ b
   · constructor
     · exact ⟨le_refl a, h⟩
     · left; rfl
   · constructor
     · have h' : b < a := Int.lt_of_not_ge h
       exact ⟨Int.le_of_lt h', le_refl b⟩
     · right; rfl

• Alternatively, use “split_ifs” without trying to label the cases. After “split_ifs” you will simply get two goals in sequence, and you can solve the first goal with a “{ … }” block and then the second with another “{ … }” block:
 
 theorem myMin_spec_satisfied (a b : Int) : myMin_spec a b (myMin a b) := by
   unfold myMin myMin_spec
   split_ifs <;>
   { -- branch where a ≤ b holds
     constructor,
     { exact ⟨le_refl a, ‹a ≤ b›⟩ },
     { left; rfl } }
   { -- branch where ¬ a ≤ b holds
     constructor,
     { have h' : b < a := Int.lt_of_not_ge ‹¬ a ≤ b›,
       exact ⟨Int.le_of_lt h', le_refl b⟩ },
     { right; rfl } }

Both alternatives remove the “case pos”/“case neg” labels that are not supported in this context.

Conclusion and Root Cause

The root cause of the error is that the given proof is using an unsupported syntax – namely the “case pos …” and “case neg …” blocks following “split_ifs”. Lean 4 does not expect this identifier-labeled block format in that context (and the indentation then leads to “unsolved goals” and an “unexpected identifier” error). The proof approach (i.e. splitting on the if–then–else) is correct for proving the specification, but the error is purely in the tactic language syntax and block structure.

To fix this, one should either use a “by_cases h : a ≤ b” approach or use “split_ifs” without naming cases and instead use proper bullet or block delimiters to separate the branches. This will allow Lean to correctly process each branch and close all the generated subgoals.
