Below is our complete walkthrough of the solution.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Understanding the Function Specification

We need a function, myMin, that takes two integers a and b and returns the smaller value. In Lean the most natural way to do this is by using an “if…then…else” conditional:  
 if a ≤ b then a else b  
When a equals b the condition a ≤ b holds, so our function will return a. This choice is acceptable since the specification allows returning either a or b when they are equal.

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Breaking Down the Problem

The problem separates into two parts:  
1. The function’s implementation.  
2. A proof that the chosen output (result) satisfies the specification:
   • result ≤ a and result ≤ b  
   • result = a or result = b

For the proof we need to consider two cases (based on the “if”):
• Case 1: a ≤ b. Then result = a, which clearly satisfies a ≤ a and, by the hypothesis, a ≤ b.
• Case 2: ¬ (a ≤ b). Then result = b. Since a ≤ b does not hold, we know that b < a (recalling that integers have a total order), so b ≤ a, and, trivially, b ≤ b.

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. Considering Inputs, Edge Cases, and Behavior

Inputs a and b are both integers. The “if” handles:
• a equal to b (we get a, and since a = b, every inequality holds)  
• a less than b (we get a which is clearly less than or equal to both)  
• a greater than b (we get b which will then be less than or equal to both results)

No unexpected edge cases occur since the conditional “if a ≤ b then a else b” naturally handles all integer comparisons.

──────────────────────────────
Step 4. Proof Techniques

For proving that our function meets the specification, we use:
• Unfolding the definitions of myMin and our spec myMin_spec.
• Then we use the tactic “split_ifs” (or alternatively “by_cases”) to split the proof into the two cases mentioned.
• In each branch, we prove the two required properties:
  – The result is less than or equal to both a and b.
  – The result equals either a or b.

This approach is similar to many simple case analyses found in Lean documentation.

──────────────────────────────
Step 5. Similar Patterns from Examples

Examples from Lean documentation show:
• Using “if…then…else” for definitions.
• How to structure proofs with tactics between “unfold” and “split_ifs” or “by_cases.”
• Structuring proofs by handling each branch completely.

Conclusion: Detailed Implementation and Proof Plan

1. Implementation:
   • Write myMin using an “if a ≤ b then a else b” conditional.
2. Proof Strategy:
   • Unfold the definitions of myMin and myMin_spec.
   • Use “split_ifs” to handle the two cases:
  – When a ≤ b: Conclude that the result equals a, which trivially satisfies result ≤ a and, by hypothesis, a ≤ b.
  – When ¬ (a ≤ b): Conclude the result equals b; then justify that b < a (and hence b ≤ a) and that b ≤ b.
   • Conclude that in each branch, myMin_spec holds.
