Below is the step‐by‐step reasoning behind our implementation and proof plan:

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Understand the Function’s Goal

• The function must take an integer n and return a Boolean value.
• It returns true if and only if n is divisible by 11. In Lean terms, n is divisible by 11 if n % 11 = 0.
• The specification given says: “n % 11 = 0 ↔ result”. In other words, the Boolean result must reflect the fact that n % 11 equals 0.

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Break Down the Problem

• Implementation: We need to check the remainder when n is divided by 11.
  – In Lean, the modulo operator “%” can be used with Int.
  – We can obtain a Boolean by comparing n % 11 to 0.
  – Lean’s boolean equality is written as “==”. (Using “==” instead of “=” is needed since “=” in Lean denotes a Proposition while “==” is for decidable Boolean equality.)
  
• Specification: We have a predicate isDivisibleBy11_spec that relates the arithmetic condition (n % 11 = 0) with the result value.
  – The theorem we need to prove shows that our implementation indeed satisfies the logical specification.
  
──────────────────────────────
Step 3. Consider Input Types, Edge Cases, and Expected Behavior

• Input type: n is of type Int. Since integers in Lean include negatives, we note that:
  – For example, (-11) % 11 is 0, so our check should correctly return true.
  – No additional data bounds or exceptional cases are needed.

• Expected behavior: For any integer n, the Boolean value “(n % 11 == 0)” works correctly across all cases.

──────────────────────────────
Step 4. Choosing the Proof Technique

• The theorem “isDivisibleBy11_spec_satisfied” unfolds the definitions:
  – After unfolding, we are left with proving n % 11 = 0 ↔ (n % 11 == 0).
  – Because our implementation directly uses “n % 11 == 0” as the computed Boolean, the two sides are definitionally equivalent.
  
• Thus the proof can be concluded by a simple “rfl” (reflexivity), once we have unfolded our definitions.
  
──────────────────────────────
Step 5. Recognizing Similar Patterns

• The pattern of “defining a specification predicate and then proving the implementation satisfies it” is common.
• In many cases the proof is just unfolding the definition and applying reflexivity. Our situation is analogous.

──────────────────────────────
Detailed Plan for Implementation and Proof

1. Implementation:
   • Define the function isDivisibleBy11 such that for any integer n it returns the Boolean value of “n % 11 == 0”. Using “==” is important because it produces a Bool (as needed by the output).

2. Specification and Proof:
   • Write the specification predicate: isDivisibleBy11_spec n result as “n % 11 = 0 ↔ result”.
   • For the theorem isDivisibleBy11_spec_satisfied, the proof will:
     - Unfold both isDivisibleBy11 and isDivisibleBy11_spec.
     - Show that after unfolding, both sides of the equivalence coincide.
     - Conclude with “rfl” (reflexivity).

Below is the complete Lean 4 code following our plan:

-------------------------------------------------
import Mathlib
import Aesop

-- Implementation:
def isDivisibleBy11 (n : Int) : Bool :=
  -- We check if the remainder on division by 11 equals zero.
  n % 11 == 0

-- Theorem specification: result is true exactly when n is divisible by 11
def isDivisibleBy11_spec (n : Int) (result : Bool) : Prop :=
  n % 11 = 0 ↔ result

-- Theorem: Our implementation satisfies the specification.
theorem isDivisibleBy11_spec_satisfied (n : Int) :
  isDivisibleBy11_spec n (isDivisibleBy11 n) := by
  -- Unfold the definitions of the function and the spec predicate.
  unfold isDivisibleBy11 isDivisibleBy11_spec
  -- The two sides are definitionally equal, so we finish by reflexivity.
  rfl
-------------------------------------------------

This plan meets the problem description:
• We implemented the function that returns a Boolean checking divisibility by 11.
• We specified the expected relation between the result and the arithmetic condition.
• We proved the equivalence by unfolding definitions and applying reflexivity.

This completes our detailed plan for both the implementation and its specification proof in Lean 4.
