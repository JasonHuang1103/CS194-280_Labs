Below is one complete solution, along with our reasoning. We first explain our thought process step by step and then give the final Lean 4 code.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Step 1. Understanding the function

We need a function that accepts an integer n and an array a. It should return true exactly when n is strictly greater than every array element. Equivalently, we must have

  ∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!

This property must hold when the function returns true; if false then at least one element is not less than n.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Step 2. Breaking down the problem

• Implementation:  
  We note that Lean’s Array structure provides an "all" method that takes a predicate (α → Bool) and returns true exactly when all elements satisfy it. In our case, we can use
     a.all (λ x => n > x)
  This definition automatically handles the empty array case (returning true by vacuity).

• Proof:  
  Our specification is that  
     (∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!) ↔ result  
  where result is what our function returns (namely, a.all (λ x => n > x)). In the proof we need to show the equivalence between the “pointwise” version (using array indices) and the “all” predicate version.

There is a well‐known pattern in Lean where arrays are converted to lists so that one may use the standard list lemma:
     list.all_eq_forall
which states that for any predicate p,
     a.toList.all p ↔ ∀ x ∈ a.toList, p x.
Since every array has the list conversion and the list length agrees with a.size, one can prove our property by relating each index i with the corresponding list membership.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Step 3. Considering Input Types and Edge Cases

• Input types:  
  – n is an Int  
  – a is an Array Int

• Edge cases:  
  – The array may be empty; in that case the predicate holds (n is greater than “every” element by vacuity), and a.all returns true.
  – If any element is greater than or equal to n the result is false.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Step 4. Proof Techniques

We plan to use the following tactics:
• Unfold the definitions
• Convert the array a to a list using a.toList, then use the known equivalence between list.all and the pointwise requirement.
• Use the helper lemma (for lists)
     list.all_eq_forall
which states:
     ∀ p : α → Bool, (l.all p) = (∀ x ∈ l, p x)
• Relate list membership with the index-based formulation in the specification. (Recall that for an array a, we have a.size = (a.toList).length and for any i < a.size, a[i]! equals nth_le (a.toList) i ...)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Step 5. Similar patterns from examples

Examples in Lean’s documentation show use of auxiliary functions (like let rec or converting between representations). The conversion from an array to a list is common and will help us apply the list lemma “list.all_eq_forall”.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Detailed Plan Summary

1. Implementation:  
   Define
     def isGreater (n : Int) (a : Array Int) : Bool := 
       a.all (λ x => n > x)

2. Specification:  
   We state that
     def isGreater_spec (n : Int) (a : Array Int) (result : Bool) : Prop :=
       (∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!) ↔ result

3. Proof:  
   Prove 
     theorem isGreater_spec_satisfied (n : Int) (a : Array Int) : 
       isGreater_spec n a (isGreater n a)
   by unfolding definitions and converting the array to a list. Use “list.all_eq_forall” to show that
       a.all (λ x => n > x)
   is equivalent to
       ∀ x ∈ a.toList, n > x.
   Then note that the latter is equivalent to  
       ∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!
   since a.toList is exactly the list of elements in a.

Final Lean 4 Code

Below is the complete Lean 4 code following our plan. (Note that some helper lemmas may already be available in Mathlib; if not, one may need to add a short proof excerpt for the list conversion.)

-----------------------------------------------------
import Mathlib
import Aesop

open Array List

-- Implementation
def isGreater (n : Int) (a : Array Int) : Bool :=
  -- We simply check if every element is strictly less than n.
  a.all (λ x => n > x)

-- Specification: 
-- The property that n is strictly greater than every element in a is equivalent to the Bool result.
def isGreater_spec (n : Int) (a : Array Int) (result : Bool) : Prop :=
  (∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!) ↔ result

-- Proof:
theorem isGreater_spec_satisfied (n : Int) (a : Array Int) :
  isGreater_spec n a (isGreater n a) := by
  -- Unfold the definitions
  unfold isGreater isGreater_spec
  -- Convert the array to a list so that we can use list.all_eq_forall  
  let l := a.toList
  -- We now show that a.all (λ x => n > x) equals (∀ x ∈ l, n > x)
  have h_all: a.all (λ x => n > x) = l.all (λ x => n > x) := by
    -- This follows because Array.all is defined in terms of a.toList.
    rfl,
  rw [h_all],
  -- Use the known lemma for lists: for any l and predicate p,
  -- l.all p = true ↔ ∀ x ∈ l, p x.
  have h_list := List.all_eq_forall l (λ x => n > x),
  rw [h_list],
  -- It remains to observe that (∀ x ∈ l, n > x) is equivalent to (∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!),
  -- by the definition of a.toList.
  -- We complete the proof by showing the equivalence of the quantifications:
  apply Iff.intro,
  · -- → direction: Assume ∀ x ∈ a.toList, n > x.
    intro h i hi,
    -- By definition, a[i]! is the (i)th element of a.toList (since a.toList has length a.size)
    have : a.toList.nthLe i hi = a[i]! := by
      simp only [Array.get?_eq_nthLe],
    rw [← this],
    apply h,
    rw [List.mem_nthLe],
    exact ⟨i, hi⟩,
  · -- ← direction: Assume ∀ i, (i < a.size → n > a[i]!).
    intros x hx,
    -- Since x ∈ a.toList, there exists an index i such that x = a[i]! (by the definition of a.toList)
    obtain ⟨i, hi, rfl⟩ := List.mem_nthLe.1 hx,
    apply ‹∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!› i hi
      

-----------------------------------------------------

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Explanation

1. The function isGreater simply uses Array.all and the predicate (λ x => n > x).  
2. The specification is given by the property that ∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]! is equivalent to the Bool that isGreater returns.  
3. In the proof, we first rewrite the result in terms of a.toList and then apply the standard list lemma list.all_eq_forall. Finally, we relate list membership with the index-based formulation using List.mem_nthLe.

This plan satisfies the original requirements and demonstrates a clear path towards both implementation and proof in Lean 4.
