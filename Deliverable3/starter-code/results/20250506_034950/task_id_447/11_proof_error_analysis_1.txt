Below is a step‐by‐step analysis of what went wrong with your proof and some suggestions on how to fix it.

──────────────────────────────
1. Identify Which Tactic Is Failing and Why

The error message says, among other things: “error: unexpected token '·'; expected command”. This tells us that Lean encountered the bullet notation (the “·” symbol) at a point where it wasn’t expecting one. In your proof you write

  constructor
· exact Array.size_map (fun x => x * x * x) a
· intros i hi
  exact Array.get_map (fun x => x * x * x) a i hi

The “·” bullet symbols are causing a parsing error. In Lean 3 these kinds of bullets (often written as “•”) are commonly used to structure proofs; in Lean 4 the bullet system is more strict about spacing and indentation (and you might even want to use a hyphen “-” or simply a new line with correct indentation) so that the bullets don’t become unexpected tokens. Because of the unexpected bullet, the tactics following them are never processed—and therefore the two subgoals (one for the size equality, one for element‐wise equality) remain unsolved.
  
──────────────────────────────
2. Consider the Proof State at That Point

After you execute the command

  unfold cubeElements cubeElements_spec

the proof state becomes a conjunction of two goals:
  
  • Goal 1: (Array.map (fun x => x * x * x) a).size = a.size
  • Goal 2: ∀ i, i < a.size → (Array.map (fun x => x * x * x) a)[i]! = a[i]! * a[i]! * a[i]!
  
Then you call the tactic

  constructor

which splits the conjunction into the two subgoals. The next two commands (intended for each subgoal) are meant to close these goals, but because the bullet (“·”) markers are not recognized as valid tactic commands, Lean never properly processes those tactics. As a result, both subgoals remain unsolved.
  
──────────────────────────────
3. Check if the Proof Approach Matches the Specification

Your overall proof outline is correct. By unfolding the definitions and applying known lemmas such as Array.size_map and Array.get_map, you are on track to showing that cubeElements (which is a map) satisfies the specification:
  
  • The size of the mapped array is equal to the original.
  • Each element in the resulting array is the cube of the corresponding element.

Thus, the overall approach does indeed match the specification; the error is purely in the presentation/syntax of your tactics.
  
──────────────────────────────
4. Identify Any Type Mismatches or Incorrect Assumptions

There are no type mismatches or logical errors in your arguments. Both Array.size_map and Array.get_map are the appropriate lemmas to use for proving the two parts of the specification. The only problem is that your bullet markers (“·”) are not being accepted. This causes the two goals to remain unsolved.
  
──────────────────────────────
5. Consider Alternative Proof Strategies

Rather than relying on the bullet symbols “·”, you have several alternatives:
  
  • Remove the bullets altogether and use a sequence of tactics separated by semicolons or newlines.
  
  • Replace the bullets “·” with hyphens “-” which are more standard in Lean 4.
  
For example, the proof could be rewritten like this:
  
  theorem cubeElements_spec_satisfied (a : Array Int) :
    cubeElements_spec a (cubeElements a) := by
    unfold cubeElements cubeElements_spec
    constructor
    · exact Array.size_map (fun x => x * x * x) a
    · intros i hi
      exact Array.get_map (fun x => x * x * x) a i hi
  
If the bullet “·” still causes issues (for example, if your editor or file encoding isn’t handling it properly), you can alternatively write:
  
  theorem cubeElements_spec_satisfied (a : Array Int) :
    cubeElements_spec a (cubeElements a) := by
    unfold cubeElements cubeElements_spec
    apply And.intro
    exact Array.size_map (fun x => x * x * x) a
    intros i hi
    exact Array.get_map (fun x => x * x * x) a i hi
  
This version avoids bullet symbols entirely.

Conclusion: Detailed Analysis of the Root Cause and Suggestions

The root cause of the error is that the bullet symbol “·” is unexpected to Lean at the point where you used it. This leads to:
  
  • Parsing errors (“unexpected token '·'; expected command”).
  • The tactics intended to close the split subgoals never being executed.
  • Consequently, unsolved goals remain (one for the size equality and one for the element-wise equality).
  
To fix this issue, you can:
  
  • Remove or replace the bullet symbols. In Lean 4 you might simply use hyphens (“-”) or write a sequence of tactics without bullets.
  • Ensure correct indentation so that Lean’s parser recognizes the structure of your tactic script.
  
Once you do this, Lean should correctly split the conjunction (using constructor or And.intro) and apply the tactics for each subgoal, successfully closing the proof.

By making these adjustments, you should be able to compile the proof without the “unexpected token '·'” error and with all subgoals solved.
