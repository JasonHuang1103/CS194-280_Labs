We want a function that “cubes” all the elements in an array and a proof that the resulting array has the same size as the original and that every element is replaced by its cube.

Below is our step‐by‐step reasoning, followed by a detailed plan for both implementation and proof.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Understanding the Function

• The function takes an Array Int (which may be empty) and returns an Array Int.
• For each element x in the input array, we output x * x * x.
• In Lean 4, a natural way of “mapping” a function over an array is to use its map method.

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Breaking Down the Problem

• Implementation: We can define
  cubeElements a = a.map (fun x => x * x * x)
This uses the built‐in Array.map that applies a function to each element.

• Proof Specification: The specification is twofold.
 1. The size of the output equals the size of the input.
 2. For each valid index i (< a.size), the i-th element of the output equals a[i]! * a[i]! * a[i]! .
 
• We plan to use existing properties of Array.map. There are typical lemmas:
 – Array.size_map : ∀ (f : α → β) (a : Array α), (a.map f).size = a.size.
 – Array.get_map   : ∀ (f : α → β) (a : Array α) (i) (h : i < a.size), (a.map f)[i]! = f (a[i]!).

Step 3. Considering Input Types and Edge Cases

• The function works on any Array Int. When passed an empty array the map returns an empty array.
• Each element, regardless of value, is cubed.

──────────────────────────────
Step 4. Proof Techniques

• After unfolding the definitions, we need to prove a conjunction (using and.intro or the bullet notation).
• The first part is about size equality – we can immediately use the Array.size_map lemma.
• The second part is the indexwise equality – we use Array.get_map.
• In Lean 4, these proofs are straightforward by unfolding definitions and applying known lemmas; tactics like constructor (or split) and intros are ideal.

──────────────────────────────
Step 5. Similar Patterns from Examples

• In the provided examples, a step-by-step breakdown using tactics like “intro”, “apply”, “exact”, and “constructor” is used.
• Similarly, we can structure the proof by first handling the size property and then the elementwise property, each as separate subgoals.

Detailed Plan

Implementation Plan:
1. Define the cubeElements function as
  def cubeElements (a : Array Int) : Array Int :=
   a.map (fun x => x * x * x)

Proof Plan (for cubeElements_spec_satisfied):
1. Unfold the definitions of cubeElements and cubeElements_spec.
2. Split the goal into two parts (size property and elementwise property).
    • For the size property, use the known fact: (a.map _).size = a.size.
    • For the elementwise property, prove that for any index i (with i < a.size), (a.map (fun x => x*x*x))[i]! = (fun x => x*x*x) (a[i]!) by using Array.get_map.
3. Conclude by combining both subgoals with an "and" introduction.

Final Lean 4 Code Sketch

Below is the complete plan as it would be written in Lean 4:

--------------------------------------------------
import Mathlib
import Aesop

-- Implementation
def cubeElements (a : Array Int) : Array Int :=
  -- Using Array.map to cube each element
  a.map (fun x => x * x * x)

-- Specification: The output array has the same size and every element is its cube.
def cubeElements_spec (a : Array Int) (result : Array Int) : Prop :=
  (result.size = a.size) ∧
  (∀ i, i < a.size → result[i]! = a[i]! * a[i]! * a[i]!)

theorem cubeElements_spec_satisfied (a : Array Int) :
  cubeElements_spec a (cubeElements a) := by
  -- Unfold the definitions for clarity.
  unfold cubeElements cubeElements_spec
  -- Split the goal into the two parts (size and elementwise properties).
  constructor
  · -- First goal: The size of the mapped array equals the size of a.
    exact Array.size_map (fun x => x * x * x) a
  · -- Second goal: For every index in range, the element in the result is the cube.
    intros i hi
    exact Array.get_map (fun x => x * x * x) a i hi
--------------------------------------------------

This plan implements the function in a straightforward way using Array.map and then proves the specification using standard lemmas on Array.map.

By following these steps, we satisfy the task requirements both in implementation and in proof.

This concludes our detailed plan for the Lean 4 function and its accompanying proof.
