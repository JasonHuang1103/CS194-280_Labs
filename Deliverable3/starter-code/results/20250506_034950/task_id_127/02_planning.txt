Below is a detailed walkthrough of the reasoning and planning process, followed by the final Lean 4 implementation and proof.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Understand the function's purpose:

• The function named multiply takes two integers a and b.  
• It is expected to compute and return their product, which is defined as a * b.

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Break down the requirements:

• The implementation is straightforward: use the built-in multiplication operator for integers (i.e. a * b).  
• The specification predicate multiply_spec is defined as result = a * b.  
• We must prove that when we call multiply a b, the predicate multiply_spec a b (multiply a b) holds.

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. Consider input types, cases, and behavior:

• The inputs are of type Int. Lean’s integer arithmetic handles various edge cases (like negative numbers, zero, etc.) correctly.  
• Since we are using the built-in multiplication, we rely on its correctness.

──────────────────────────────
Step 4. Proof techniques:

• After unfolding the definitions of multiply and multiply_spec, the goal reduces to showing a * b = a * b.  
• This becomes trivial by the reflexivity of equality. The tactic “rfl” will complete the proof.

──────────────────────────────
Step 5. Similar patterns:

• Many Lean proofs that verify simple functions use the "unfold" tactic to expand definitions.
• In such situations, using “rfl” (which stands for “reflexivity”) is sufficient to conclude that both sides of an equation are identical.

──────────────────────────────
Plan Summary:

1. Implementation:  
   • Define multiply to simply return a * b.

2. Proof:  
   • Unfold the definitions of multiply and multiply_spec.  
   • Use the reflexivity tactic (rfl) to establish that the two expressions are equal.

Final Lean 4 Code:

import Mathlib
import Aesop

-- Implementation
def multiply (a : Int) (b : Int) : Int :=
  -- << CODE START >>
  a * b
  -- << CODE END >>

-- Theorem: The result should be the product of the two input integers
def multiply_spec (a : Int) (b : Int) (result : Int) : Prop :=
  -- << SPEC START >>
  result = a * b
  -- << SPEC END >>

theorem multiply_spec_satisfied (a : Int) (b : Int) :
  multiply_spec a b (multiply a b) := by
  -- << PROOF START >>
  unfold multiply multiply_spec
  rfl
  -- << PROOF END >>

This code meets the specification by implementing multiplication and providing a proof that the multiply function indeed returns the product of its two integer arguments.
