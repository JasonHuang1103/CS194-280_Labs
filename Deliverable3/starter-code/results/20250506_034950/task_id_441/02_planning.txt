Below is a detailed explanation of the thought process and the resulting plan.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Understand the Task

• We need a function that takes an integer "size" (the edge length of the cube) and returns its surface area.
• The standard formula for the surface area of a cube is 6 × (size²). That is, area = 6 * size * size.
• The specification is formalized by the predicate cubeSurfaceArea_spec stating that the result must equal 6 * size * size.

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Break Down the Problem

• Implementation Subproblem:
  - Define a Lean function cubeSurfaceArea that receives an Int and returns 6 * size * size.
  - There is a straightforward mapping to the standard formula.
  
• Proof Subproblem:
  - The theorem cubeSurfaceArea_spec_satisfied should show that for any integer "size", our function satisfies cubeSurfaceArea_spec.
  - The proof will reduce the definitions and check that the returned value indeed equals 6 * size * size.
  
──────────────────────────────
Step 3. Consider Input Types, Edge Cases, and Expected Behavior

• The input is an integer. Although negative sizes don't make sense for a cube, the problem note states that the input is assumed to be greater than 0.
• There is no need for additional error handling because the assumption is in place.
• The function and the proof use basic arithmetic with integers.

──────────────────────────────
Step 4. Identify Appropriate Proof Techniques

• The proof is very direct since the function definition matches the specification exactly.
• A straightforward technique is to “unfold” (or expand) the definitions and then conclude by reflexivity (using rfl) or by applying simp which figures out both sides are definitionally equal.
• Since both sides are computed using the same arithmetic operations, Lean’s simplifier can confirm equality quickly.

──────────────────────────────
Step 5. Note Similar Patterns or Examples

• This sort of proof by unfolding definitions and then applying rfl is common in Lean when working with simple arithmetic specifications.
• In many Lean examples, a definition and its specification are evidently equal by computation, so no further rewriting or induction is required.

Final Detailed Plan

1. Implementation:
   - Write the function cubeSurfaceArea that multiplies 6 by size and size (i.e., 6 * size * size).
   
2. Proof:
   - For the theorem cubeSurfaceArea_spec_satisfied, start by unfolding the definitions of both cubeSurfaceArea and cubeSurfaceArea_spec.
   - When the definitions are expanded, the goal will be to show that 6 * size * size equals 6 * size * size.
   - Use rfl (reflexivity) to finalize the proof since the equality is evident.

──────────────────────────────
Putting It All Together

We will now provide the Lean code that implements the function and proves the theorem:

-------------------------------------------------
import Mathlib
import Aesop

-- Implementation
def cubeSurfaceArea (size : Int) : Int :=
  -- << CODE START >>
  6 * size * size
  -- << CODE END >>

-- Theorem: The surface area of the cube is calculated correctly
def cubeSurfaceArea_spec (size : Int) (result : Int) : Prop :=
  -- << SPEC START >>
  result = 6 * size * size
  -- << SPEC END >>

theorem cubeSurfaceArea_spec_satisfied (size : Int):
  cubeSurfaceArea_spec size (cubeSurfaceArea size) := by
  -- << PROOF START >>
  unfold cubeSurfaceArea cubeSurfaceArea_spec
  rfl
  -- << PROOF END >>
-------------------------------------------------

──────────────────────────────
Summary

• The function cubeSurfaceArea directly computes 6 * size * size.
• The proof unfolds the definitions and uses reflexivity (rfl) to show that the computed result meets the specification.
• This approach leverages Lean’s computation rules and is an established technique for such “obviously equal” arithmetic proofs.

This concludes the detailed plan for both the implementation and the proof.
