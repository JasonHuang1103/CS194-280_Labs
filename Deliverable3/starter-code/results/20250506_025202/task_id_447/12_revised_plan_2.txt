Below is an analysis of the error messages and a discussion of improvements. In our example, there are two main issues:

──────────────────────────────
1. Identifying the Error Patterns

• “unsolved goals” for the subproofs:
  – The error showing that the goal “(Array.map (fun x => x * x * x) a).size = a.size” remains unsolved indicates that the proof tactic for this part did not automatically close the goal.
  – (Similarly, the second goal about the element-by-element equality wasn’t solved.)

• “unexpected token '·'; expected command”
  – This indicates that the bullet token (the Unicode “·” used for structuring a proof) is not being accepted in the current Lean mode or your Lean environment. (Sometimes Lean users may have issues with using these bullet symbols if the environment is not configured to accept them.)

──────────────────────────────
2. What Isn’t Working

• The approach in the proof was to use a bullet style (using “·”) to divide the proof into subgoals. While this technique is common in Lean proofs, there might be problems if the Lean configuration (or version) does not support the chosen bullet token.
  
• The use of tactics such as simp with the hint [Array.get_map] assumes that Lean knows the “map” property. If the simp set does not automatically fire this lemma (or if it is named differently in your version of mathlib), then Lean will leave unsolved goals.

──────────────────────────────
3. Alternative Approaches

To fix these problems, consider the following changes:

A. Implementation:
  – The implementation itself is fine. It is best to use the Array.map function:
  
    cubeElements a := a.map (fun x => x * x * x)
    
  – No changes are required in this part.

B. Proof Strategy:
  – Instead of bullet tokens “·” that might cause an “unexpected token” error, you can use a begin ... end block (or the curly-brace style) with explicit tactic commands.
  
  – Split the conjunction explicitly using “split” or “apply And.intro” rather than relying solely on bullet formatting.
  
  – For the first part of the proof, you can use a property such as Array.map_length (or the corresponding lemma that proves that mapping preserves length) to conclude (a.map f).size = a.size.
  
  – For the second part, rather than just relying on simp, you might want to explicitly note the property that for any f and index i, (a.map f)[i]! = f (a[i]!) holds if i is a valid index (or use the fact proved by a lemma like Array.get_map).
  
  – For clarity, you may want to avoid bullets by using “begin … end” with curly braces { … } to delimit the proof of each subgoal.

4. Revised Detailed Plan

A. Revised Implementation

  • Keep the function definition the same:
  
    def cubeElements (a : Array Int) : Array Int :=
      a.map (fun x => x * x * x)

B. Revised Proof Approach

  • Unfold the definitions of cubeElements and cubeElements_spec.
  
  • Use the tactic “split” (or “apply And.intro”) to prove the two parts:
    1. Prove the mapped array’s length equals a.size.
       – Use the fact (or lemma) that “Array.map_length” gives (a.map f).size = a.size.
       
    2. Prove that for each valid index i, the element in the result equals the cube of a[i]!.
       – Introduce an arbitrary index i with “intro i” and the hypothesis i < a.size.
       – Use either “simp” with a known lemma (e.g., Array.get_map) or rewrite using that property.

C. Revised Code Template

We now present the revised code that avoids the bullet (·) token and instead uses a begin ... end block with curly brackets:

-----------------------------------------------------------
import Mathlib
import Aesop

-- Implementation
def cubeElements (a : Array Int) : Array Int :=
  a.map (fun x => x * x * x)

-- Specification: The output array has the same size as the input,
-- and for every index i, (cubeElements a)[i]! is the cube of a[i]!.
def cubeElements_spec (a : Array Int) (result : Array Int) : Prop :=
  (result.size = a.size) ∧ (∀ i, i < a.size → result[i]! = a[i]! * a[i]! * a[i]!)

theorem cubeElements_spec_satisfied (a : Array Int) :
  cubeElements_spec a (cubeElements a) :=
begin
  -- Unfold the definitions to reveal the structure of the goal.
  unfold cubeElements cubeElements_spec,
  -- Split the conjunction into two separate subgoals.
  split,
  { -- First subgoal: prove that the mapped array has the same length as the input.
    exact Array.map_length (fun x => x * x * x) a,
  },
  { -- Second subgoal: prove elementwise cubing.
    intros i hi,
    -- Use the array property that for Array.map: (a.map f)[i]! = f (a[i]!).
    rw Array.get_map,
    -- This reduces the goal to verifying that a[i]! * a[i]! * a[i]! equals itself.
    refl,
  }
end
-----------------------------------------------------------

──────────────────────────────
5. Summary of Specific Changes

• Implementation: No change was required; the use of a.map (fun x => x * x * x) is correct.
  
• Proof Changes:
  - Replace the problematic bullet “·” with an explicit begin ... end block.
  - Use “split” to handle the conjunction explicitly.
  - In the first subgoal, call exact Array.map_length (with the appropriate function and input) to close the goal.
  - For the second subgoal, use “intros” followed by rewriting with Array.get_map and finish with refl.
  
This revised plan addresses both the “unsolved goals” (by explicitly using known lemmas and tactics) and avoids the bullet token issue that was causing the “unexpected token '·'” error.

Using this strategy, the function and the proof are both well-structured and should compile correctly in Lean 4.
