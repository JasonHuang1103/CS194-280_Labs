Below is a step‐by‐step explanation of what’s happening:

─────────────────────────────  
1. Identifying the Failing Tactic

The error message tells us that the tactic “split” “failed” at the point where your proof is trying to break the goal into two parts. In Lean a goal of the form P ∧ Q is usually split into two subgoals – one proving P and one proving Q. In our case, after unfolding the definitions the goal is

  (Array.map (fun x => x * x * x) a).size = a.size ∧
  ∀ i, i < a.size → (Array.map (fun x => x * x * x) a)[i]! = a[i]! * a[i]! * a[i]!

so “split” should work. However, the error indicates it “failed”.  

─────────────────────────────  
2. Considering the Proof State

After the command

  unfold cubeElements cubeElements_spec

the goal becomes exactly the conjunction above. So in principle it should be “splittable.” Yet Lean’s message about “unexpected identifier” on the following line hints that something went wrong in the parsing of your proof script. In particular, Lean 4 is very sensitive to the indentation and layout of tactic blocks.

3. Matching the Proof Approach to the Specification

The idea is perfectly sound: you prove the left conjunct by using Array.map_length and then you prove the right conjunct by taking an arbitrary index i and showing that the map “cubes” the corresponding element. This approach exactly matches the specification given by cubeElements_spec.

─────────────────────────────  
4. Checking for Type Mismatches or Incorrect Assumptions

There isn’t any type mismatch in the mathematical content. Instead, the error “unexpected identifier; expected command” strongly suggests that Lean got confused by the structure of your tactic block – it did not see the separate commands for the two subgoals as you intended. In Lean 4, after using a tactic like “split” you need to ensure that the tactics for each subgoal are indented correctly so that Lean knows what belongs to which subproof. For example, you want something like:

  split
   exact Array.map_length (fun x => x * x * x) a
   intro i hi
   rw Array.get_map
   refl

If the indentation isn’t right, Lean might interpret the “exact …” and “intros …” as continuing the “split” line or as unparsed identifiers in the wrong place.

─────────────────────────────  
5. Alternative Proof Strategies

There are a few ways to fix or work around the problem:
 • Adjust the layout. Make sure that immediately after “split” you indent each of the tactic blocks for the two parts. In Lean 4 the indentation tells Lean what “block” each command is in.
 • Instead of “split”, you could use “apply And.intro … …” in one go.
 • You might also try using separate tactic blocks (possibly with braces {}) to clearly delimit the proofs for the two conjuncts.

Conclusion and Root Cause Analysis

The root problem is not a mismatch of types or a wrong high‐level idea. Instead, the error comes from how the tactic block is structured: after unfolding your definitions, the “split” tactic was used but the following proof steps were not indented properly (or otherwise formatted) so that Lean could see them as providing the two subproofs. In other words, Lean was expecting separate tactic blocks for the two halves of the ∧ and instead saw “unexpected identifiers.”

To fix this error, you need to adjust the indentation (or use braces) to indicate clearly that you are giving two separate subproofs. For example:

--------------------------------------------------
theorem cubeElements_spec_satisfied (a : Array Int) :
  cubeElements_spec a (cubeElements a) := by
  unfold cubeElements cubeElements_spec
  split
  · exact Array.map_length (fun x => x * x * x) a
  · intro i hi
    rw Array.get_map
    refl
--------------------------------------------------

This makes it clear to Lean that there are two separate cases to prove. Once you get the formatting and indentation right, “split” will work as expected and your proof will go through.

Summary

1. The tactic that fails is “split.”
2. The intended proof state is a conjunction, which “split” should decompose.
3. The overall approach (showing the length property and then the elementwise property) is correct.
4. The error isn’t due to a type mismatch in the mathematics – it is caused by the incorrect formatting/indentation of the tactic block.
5. To fix the error, re-indent the tactic steps (or group them with braces) so that each subgoal is clearly handled.

Following this line of reasoning should lead you to a working proof.
