Below is an analysis of the error messages and a revised strategy for implementing the Lean 4 function and proof.

──────────────────────────────
1. Identifying Patterns in the Errors

• Unsolved goals:
  – The first error indicates that the goal (a.map f).size = a.size wasn’t solved—this shows that the tactic used to prove that the length is preserved did not automatically finish the proof.
  – Similarly, the second goal for the elementwise equality (∀ i, i < a.size → (a.map f)[i]! = a[i]! * a[i]! * a[i]!) did not get resolved by the tactic chosen.

• Unexpected token '·':
  – The Lean error about the token '·' (a bullet) suggests that your environment does not accept bullet tokens in the expected mode. This means that the bullet style used (e.g., “·”) is causing syntax errors.

──────────────────────────────
2. What Isn’t Working

• In the proof, using bullet tokens (·) is causing an “unexpected token” error. In some Lean configurations or versions, you must use a begin … end block with explicit tactic commands rather than relying on bullets.
  
• Relying solely on tactics like simp to close subgoals without explicitly invoking known lemmas (like Array.map_length or Array.get_map) may leave unsolved goals. A more explicit tactic style is needed.

──────────────────────────────
3. Alternative Implementation Approaches

A. Implementation:
  • The implementation can remain as using Array.map. The function definition
    cubeElements a := a.map (fun x => x * x * x)
  is correct and needs no changes.

B. Proof Strategy:
  • Instead of bullets, use a begin ... end block. Within that block, explicitly split the conjunction with the tactic split (or apply And.intro) so that each subgoal is handled separately.
  • For the first subgoal (proving the length equality), use a lemma like Array.map_length that shows that mapping a function preserves array length.
  • For the second subgoal (proving the elementwise property), introduce the index i (with intros) and then use a rewrite (using Array.get_map) to justify that (a.map f)[i]! equals f (a[i]!).

──────────────────────────────
4. Revised Detailed Plan

A. Revised Implementation

Keep the function definition as follows:
  
  def cubeElements (a : Array Int) : Array Int :=
    a.map (fun x => x * x * x)

B. Revised Specification and Proof

Unfold the definitions and use split to separate the two conjuncts in the specification. In the proof:
  1. Call exact Array.map_length (fun x => x * x * x) a to prove that the length of the mapped array equals a.size.
  2. For elementwise equality, introduce an arbitrary index i and hypothesis hi, then rewrite using Array.get_map, and reduce the goal to a trivial equality (using refl).

C. Revised Code Template

Below is the complete revised code:

-----------------------------------------------------------
import Mathlib
import Aesop

-- Implementation
def cubeElements (a : Array Int) : Array Int :=
  a.map (fun x => x * x * x)

-- Specification: The output array has the same size as the input,
-- and for each index i, (cubeElements a)[i]! equals a[i]! cubed.
def cubeElements_spec (a : Array Int) (result : Array Int) : Prop :=
  (result.size = a.size) ∧ (∀ i, i < a.size → result[i]! = a[i]! * a[i]! * a[i]!)

theorem cubeElements_spec_satisfied (a : Array Int) :
  cubeElements_spec a (cubeElements a) :=
begin
  -- Unfold the definitions to see all components of the goal
  unfold cubeElements cubeElements_spec,
  -- Split the conjunction into two parts
  split,
  { -- Prove that mapping preserves the length of the array.
    exact Array.map_length (fun x => x * x * x) a,
  },
  { -- Prove the elementwise property:
    intros i hi,
    -- Use the array property that mapping gives: (a.map f)[i]! = f (a[i]!).
    rw Array.get_map,
    -- The resulting equality is reflexively true.
    refl,
  }
end
-----------------------------------------------------------

5. Summary of Specific Changes

• Implementation:
  - The function implementation was correct; continue to use a.map (fun x => x * x * x).

• Proof Changes:
  - Replace bullet tokens (such as “·”) with an explicit begin ... end block.
  - Use the split tactic to separate the proof into two parts; this avoids syntactic issues with bullets.
  - For the first subgoal, explicitly invoke the lemma Array.map_length to conclude (a.map f).size = a.size.
  - For the second subgoal, use intros to bring in the index and its bound, then use a rewrite with Array.get_map followed by refl to finish the proof.

This revised strategy addresses the “unsolved goals” (by explicitly dealing with each proof component) and the “unexpected token '·'” error (by avoiding bullets altogether). Following this plan should result in a compilation–ready Lean 4 implementation and proof.
