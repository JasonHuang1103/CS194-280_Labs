Below is our detailed reasoning process along with a plan for both the implementation and the correctness proof.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Understanding the Function Specification

• The function, cubeElements, takes an array of integers (Array Int) as input.  
• It returns another array of the same size such that each element is replaced by its cube (i.e. x³, computed as x * x * x).  
• For example, given [2, -3, 0], the output should be [8, -27, 0].

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Breaking Down the Problem

• The problem is naturally divided into two parts:

  1. The implementation: how to transform the array.
     - We need to traverse the array and replace each element.  
     - Lean’s Array API provides a map function that applies a function to every element, maintaining the size of the collection.

  2. The specification (cubeElements_spec):  
     - The first part states that the length of the output is equal to the length of the input.
     - The second part states that for every index i, the element at position i in the result equals a[i]! cubed.
  
• Edge Case: If the input array is empty, the output should also be an empty array. The map operation behaves correctly for an empty array.

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. Considering the Input Types and Expected Behavior

• Input Type: Array Int, which may be empty or non-empty.  
• Expected Behavior:  
  - Use Array.map to iterate over each element.  
  - The multiplication operation (×) is well-defined for Int.
  - There is no concern about overflow within the scope of this specification.
  
──────────────────────────────
Step 4. Reasoning About the Proof Techniques

• We need to prove the specification for cubeElements:
  
  1. Prove that the size of cubeElements a is the same as the size of a.
     - We can rely on the property of Array.map that it preserves the length of the array.
  
  2. Prove that for every valid index i, (cubeElements a)[i]! = a[i]! * a[i]! * a[i]!.
     - Again, the map function applies the given function (cubing in our case) exactly to each element.
     - We can use the fact that for any function f, (a.map f)[i]! = f (a[i]!) when i is a valid index.
  
• Tactics that will be helpful:
  - unfold: to expand the definition of cubeElements and cubeElements_spec.
  - simp: to simplify using the properties of Array.map.  
  - intro: to introduce a generic index i.
  
──────────────────────────────
Step 5. Noting Similar Patterns from Examples

• The Lean examples in the documentation show that using bullet proofs and tactics such as intro and simp can simplify a proof that involves working with arrays, especially when proving properties of functions defined with map.
• Since Lean’s Array.map is known to preserve array length and apply the {−!} property (i.e. index evaluation) as desired, the proof mostly reduces to unfolding the definitions and applying these properties.

──────────────────────────────
Final Detailed Plan

Implementation Plan:
1. Write cubeElements by calling a.map with the function (λ x => x * x * x).  
   This guarantees maintaining the same array size and applies cubing to each element.

Proof Plan:
1. Unfold both cubeElements and cubeElements_spec to see the structure of the goal.
2. Use the facts about Array.map:
   - That (a.map f).size = a.size.
   - That for every index i such that i < a.size, (a.map f)[i]! = f (a[i]!).
3. Apply these properties with simp (or by rewriting) to conclude both parts of the specification.

Final Code Template with Plan Implemented

Below is our fully annotated Lean 4 code based on our plan:

-----------------------------------------------------------
import Mathlib
import Aesop

-- Implementation
def cubeElements (a : Array Int) : Array Int :=
  -- << CODE START >>
  a.map (fun x => x * x * x)
  -- << CODE END >>

-- Specification: The length of the output array must be the same as the length of the input array,
-- and each element in the output array is the cube of the corresponding element in the input array.
def cubeElements_spec (a : Array Int) (result : Array Int) : Prop :=
  -- << SPEC START >>
  (result.size = a.size) ∧
  (∀ i, i < a.size → result[i]! = a[i]! * a[i]! * a[i]!)
  -- << SPEC END >>

theorem cubeElements_spec_satisfied (a : Array Int) :
  cubeElements_spec a (cubeElements a) := by
  -- << PROOF START >>
  -- Unfold definitions to expose the underlying structure.
  unfold cubeElements cubeElements_spec
  -- Split the conjunction into two separate goals.
  constructor
  · -- Prove that (a.map _) produces an array of the same size as a.
    exact Array.map_length _
  · -- Prove that for every index i, the i-th element of (a.map _) is the cube of a[i]!.
    intro i hi
    -- By definition of Array.map, we know that (a.map f)[i]! = f (a[i]!).
    simp [Array.get_map]
  -- << PROOF END >>
-----------------------------------------------------------

This detailed plan and implementation meet the requirements of the problem:
• The function correctly maps every element to its cube.
• The proof then verifies both clauses of our specification.

This strategy ensures that the solution is both correct and well-structured in Lean 4.
