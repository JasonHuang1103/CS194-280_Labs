Below is a step‐by‐step analysis of the error and what’s going wrong in the proof.

──────────────────────────── Step 1: Which tactic is failing and why

• The intended plan is to use the constructor tactic to prove the conjunction that defines cubeElements_spec. That produces two subgoals: one for the array length equality and one for the element‐wise equality.
• After calling constructor, the proof uses “·” bullets to supply proofs for the two subgoals. However, Lean reports an “unexpected token '·'; expected command” error at the line that starts with “·”. This indicates that the bullet syntax is not being properly recognized in its current context.
• Additionally, note that the first subgoal is attempted with “exact Array.map_length _”. Here the underscore is meant to “fill in” an argument, but Lean cannot infer the value here. (More later.)

──────────────────────────── Step 2: What is the proof state at that point

After the line

 unfold cubeElements cubeElements_spec

the proof goal becomes to prove
 (Array.map (fun x => x * x * x) a).size = a.size ∧ (∀ i, i < a.size → (Array.map (fun x => x * x * x) a)[i]! = a[i]! * a[i]! * a[i]!)

After invoking the tactic

 constructor

the proof state splits into two subgoals:
 • Left goal: (Array.map (fun x => x * x * x) a).size = a.size
 • Right goal: ∀ i, i < a.size → (Array.map (fun x => x * x * x) a)[i]! = a[i]! * a[i]! * a[i]!

Thus, the remaining tactics (the two “·” bullet blocks) are meant to solve these two subgoals. Because of the bullet (“·”) syntax issues, they are not being treated as the follow-up for each subgoal.

──────────────────────────── Step 3: Checking if the proof approach matches the specification

The proof approach is sound in spirit:

• You need to prove that cubeElements produces an array of the same length (left goal) and that each element of the resulting array is the cube of the corresponding element (right goal).
• The method of unfolding definitions and applying constructor to prove the conjunction makes sense.
• The individual subproofs (using Array.map_length for the first, and simp [Array.get_map] for the second) are also on the right track.

──────────────────────────── Step 4: Identifying any type mismatches or incorrect assumptions

There are two issues in this part:
 
1. Bullets and indentation:
 • Lean 4 is very sensitive to how tactics (and bullets) are indented. The “·” bullets here are not indented properly as sub-tactic blocks under the “by” block. That “unexpected token” error tells you that Lean wasn’t expecting a bullet at that place.

2. Use of underscore in “exact Array.map_length _”:
 • The proof writes “exact Array.map_length _”. Lean cannot figure out what the argument should be here – you intended for the value “a” to be passed to Array.map_length. (In Lean, Array.map_length : ∀ {α β} (a : Array α) (f : α → β), (a.map f).size = a.size.) So, you should explicitly supply “a”. Otherwise, Lean sees the “_” as an insufficient proof term.

──────────────────────────── Step 5: Considering alternative proof strategies

Two alternative approaches are available:

A. Fix the bullet indentation and supply all needed arguments explicitly. For instance, you may rewrite the proof as:

 theorem cubeElements_spec_satisfied (a : Array Int) :
  cubeElements_spec a (cubeElements a) := by
  unfold cubeElements cubeElements_spec
  constructor
    exact Array.map_length a
  intro i hi
  simp [Array.get_map]

Here, the bullets are indented to clearly indicate that they solve the two subgoals produced by constructor.

B. Alternatively, you might combine the proof into one tactic block (or use multiple tactics like “apply And.intro”) to avoid bullet issues altogether.

──────────────────────────── Detailed Analysis and Root Cause

The root cause of the error is twofold:

• The bullet (“·”) tokens in your proof are not correctly indented or placed, so Lean does not know that they are supposed to be sub-goals handled by the earlier constructor tactic.
• The use of “exact Array.map_length _” leaves an implicit argument that Lean cannot resolve. You must provide “a” explicitly.

To fix it, you should:
1. Remove or correctly indent the bullet tokens so that they properly belong to the tactic block. In Lean 4, ensure that your bullets are indented beneath the previous tactic command.
2. Replace the underscore in the first subgoal with the explicit parameter “a”; i.e., use “exact Array.map_length a”.

Following these steps will allow Lean to correctly process the proof without encountering an “unexpected token” error or unsolved subgoals.

──────────────────────────── Final Suggestion

A corrected version of the proof could be:

 theorem cubeElements_spec_satisfied (a : Array Int) :
  cubeElements_spec a (cubeElements a) := by
  unfold cubeElements cubeElements_spec
  constructor
    exact Array.map_length a
  intro i hi
  simp [Array.get_map]

This version should be accepted by Lean 4.
