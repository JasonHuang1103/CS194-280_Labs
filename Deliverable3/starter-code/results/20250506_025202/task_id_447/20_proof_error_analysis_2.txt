Below is a step‐by‐step analysis of the problem:

──────────────────────────────
1. Tactic That Fails and Why

• The error message complains that the tactic “split” failed and then “unexpected token ‘·’ ”. In Lean 4 the tactic “split” is meant to break down a goal that is a conjunction (an “∧” statement) into the two subgoals. The error indicates that after “split” the expected “subgoal blocks” (usually marked by bullet tokens) are not parsed correctly. In short, Lean is “surprised” by the bullet token (the “·”) after split.

──────────────────────────────
2. What the Proof State Looks Like

• After the line
  unfold cubeElements cubeElements_spec
the goal becomes (roughly)
  (Array.map (fun x => x * x * x) a).size = a.size ∧ (∀ i, i < a.size → (Array.map (fun x => x * x * x) a)[i]! = a[i]! * a[i]! * a[i]!)
which is a conjunction. Thus, the intended use of “split” is correct because it should break this into two separate goals:
 Goal 1: (Array.map … a).size = a.size 
 Goal 2: ∀ i, i < a.size → … 
However, because of improper formatting/indentation the following bullets (starting with “·”) are not attached to the split “subproofs” but are treated as unexpected tokens.

──────────────────────────────
3. Proof Approach vs. Specification

• The idea is to show that cubeElements meets the specification defined by cubeElements_spec. Splitting a conjunction into two parts is the natural approach. The first part (equality of sizes) is intended to be handled by an “exact Array.map_size” proof and the second (element-wise property) by a small “intros; simp” style argument.
• So the general plan exactly matches the specification. There are no inherent logical flaws in the idea.

──────────────────────────────
4. Type Mismatches or Incorrect Assumptions

• There doesn’t seem to be a type mismatch in the unfoldings or in the use of Array.map. The definition of cubeElements_spec is a conjunction (∧) so “split” is the correct tactic.
• One minor point is that the use of “exact Array.map_size _” has an underscore that Lean would need to fill in with the proper argument (if Array.map_size is a lemma expecting an argument). But the error message is about “unexpected token ‘·’” so the underscore is not the primary source of the problem.
• The error comes before the tactics that use “exact” and “intros” can be processed.

──────────────────────────────
5. Alternative Proof Strategies

• Instead of using “split” with bullets, you might try:
 • Using “constructor” to build the proof of a conjunction.
 • If you want to keep the bullet style, you need to ensure that the bullets are indented properly so that Lean’s parser associates them with the “split” subgoals.
 • For example, you can write the proof as:

  theorem cubeElements_spec_satisfied (a : Array Int) :
   cubeElements_spec a (cubeElements a) :=
  by
    unfold cubeElements cubeElements_spec
    split
    · exact Array.map_size _
    · intro i hi
      simp [Array.get_map]

Note that the bullet “·” lines must be indented one level relative to the “split” command.

──────────────────────────────
Detailed Root Cause and Direction for Fixing It

• The root cause is not a logical error in the proof but a formatting/indentation issue in the tactic block. Lean 4’s parser relies on indentation (or explicit delimiters) to know when you’re providing subproofs after a tactic like “split.” In your code the bullets “·” are not indented properly relative to “split,” so Lean sees the “·” tokens as “unexpected tokens” in the middle of the proof script.
• To fix the error, adjust the formatting so that the bullet lines are indented appropriately. You might also write the proof without bullets by sequencing tactics, for example:

  theorem cubeElements_spec_satisfied (a : Array Int) :
   cubeElements_spec a (cubeElements a) :=
  by
    unfold cubeElements cubeElements_spec
    constructor
    · exact Array.map_size _
    constructor
    · intros i hi; simp [Array.get_map]

or 

  theorem cubeElements_spec_satisfied (a : Array Int) :
   cubeElements_spec a (cubeElements a) :=
  by
    unfold cubeElements cubeElements_spec
    split
    -- first subgoal:
    exact Array.map_size _
    -- second subgoal:
    intros i hi; simp [Array.get_map]

Make sure that the bullet markers “·” (or dash “-”) begin at an indentation level that is deeper than the “split” command line. This tells Lean that these tactics are the bodies for the subgoals produced by “split.”

──────────────────────────────
In Summary

The error arises from Lean not expecting the bullet (·) tokens after your “split” command because of a formatting/indentation mistake. The proof approach is correct with respect to the specification, but Lean’s tactic mode requires that the subgoal bullets be indented appropriately so that they are associated with the “split”-generated subgoals. Adjusting the indentation (or removing the bullets altogether and sequencing tactics without bullets) should resolve the error.
