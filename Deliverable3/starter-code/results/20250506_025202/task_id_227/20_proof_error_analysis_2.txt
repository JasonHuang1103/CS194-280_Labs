Below is an analysis of what goes wrong in the proof, broken down step‐by‐step. (Note that there are two “issues” at work here: one coming from the way the if–then–else expression is “unfolded” in the goal and one coming from tactic–bullet/indentation problems.)

────────────────────────────────────────
1. Identifying the Failing Tactic

• In the proof you use
  unfold minOfThree minOfThree_spec
  by_cases h₁ : a ≤ b
    …
•
The error “unsolved goals” and “unexpected token ‘·’” appears later. In the “pos” and “neg” cases the goal still contains the if–then–else expression. That is, after unfolding your definitions, the goal is
  (if a ≤ b then if a ≤ c then a else c else if b ≤ c then b else c) ≤ a ∧ … 
so the branches have not been “simplified” into the actual value (either a, b, or c). Because the conditional is not reduced by the tactic steps you’ve written, later you start a branch (with the bullet “·”) where Lean does not know what to do with the remaining if–then–else.

• In short, the tactic chain fails because you split on a condition (by_cases h₁) but you do not “remove” the if–then–else that references the same condition. (Often one would use the “split_ifs” tactic—or structure the proof with pattern matching—to eliminate the ifs once and for all.)

────────────────────────────────────────
2. Considering the Proof State at That Point

• After the call to “unfold” the goal still has a nested if–then–else inside. You then invoke “by_cases h₁ : a ≤ b” to split on the condition “a ≤ b”. In the branch where h₁ holds, the goal is still
  (if a ≤ b then if a ≤ c then a else c ... ) ≤ a ∧ ...
Even though you have a hypothesis h₁, the if–then–else did not automatically “choose” the corresponding branch (i.e. “a ≤ b” remains in the term).
• This means that in every branch the goal still contains an if–then–else term that “remembers” the condition instead of having been simplified to, say, “if a ≤ c then a else c.”
• Then when you try to introduce bullet markers (the “·” symbols) to mark subcases, Lean finds that the goal is still not “in a good form” and sometimes gets confused by extra bullets or wrong indentation.

────────────────────────────────────────
3. Checking if the Proof Approach Matches the Specification

• The specification minOfThree_spec requires showing two things: that the result is below a, b, and c and that it equals one of a, b, or c.
• In your proof you plan to split according to the conditions a ≤ b and then a ≤ c (or, in the other branch, b ≤ c). This is a good idea in principle; however, the approach assumed that unfolding minOfThree would leave a “case‐split form” that immediately gives you “result = a” etc.
• Because the if–then–else is not automatically “simplified” after unfolding (and because of the indentation/bullet markers), the approach does not match the specification directly. You have to simplify the if–then–else by either:
  – using “split_ifs” (or “simp”) to remove the if–then–else, or 
  – proving a lemma that describes minOfThree by doing a case split on its conditions.
• Without one of these, the goal remains stuck in an “if–term” form.

────────────────────────────────────────
4. Identifying Type Mismatches or Incorrect Assumptions

• One potential concern is in the branch where you assume “by_cases h₂ : a ≤ c” is false. Here you use “Not.le.mp h₂” to obtain a proof of c < a and then call “le_trans” with h₁.
  – Although a strict inequality c < a does imply c ≤ a, one must be careful that the coercion is recognized by Lean.
  – More importantly, the use of “Not.le.mp” is only valid if Lean has the proper lemma (or conversion) loaded; otherwise you might have type‐mismatch issues.
• In any case, the main “unsolved goal” error does not come from a type mismatch but from the fact that the if–then–else structure isn’t eliminated.

────────────────────────────────────────
5. Considering Alternative Proof Strategies

• One alternative is to use “split_ifs” immediately after unfolding. For example, after the “unfold …” line, inserting “split_ifs” will rewrite the if–then–else expression into the corresponding case splits.
• Another strategy is to prove a lemma about minOfThree (e.g., by pattern–matching on its definition) and then use that lemma to conclude the specification.
• Finally, you might also adjust the bullet indentation. In Lean 4 the bullet markers (like “·”) have significance with respect to indentation. Sometimes misaligned bullets cause “unexpected token” errors. Make sure that each “by_cases” and its subproofs are indented correctly.

────────────────────────────────────────
Conclusion: Detailed Root Cause and Direction for Fixing

The root cause of the error is twofold:
 1. The unfolded definition of minOfThree leaves a nested if–then–else in the goal. By splitting on a condition with “by_cases” you assume that the goal becomes the simplified branch (say “a” or “c”), but it doesn’t. Without eliminating the if’s (for example with “split_ifs”), Lean’s goal remains too complex, and your “split” tactic (and the subsequent bullet markers “·”) ends up being applied to a term that still has an unresolved conditional.
 2. The bullet markers (“·”) in Lean 4 are very sensitive to indentation. The “unexpected token ‘·’” error indicates that at some point the bullet appears where Lean does not expect it (likely because the previous block wasn’t finished or the if-term wasn’t simplified).

To fix the proof:
 – Insert a tactic like “split_ifs” (or “dsimp”/“simp” with appropriate lemmas) after “unfold minOfThree …” so that the if–then–else expression is replaced by its corresponding branch.
 – Double–check the indentation and bullet markers. Ensure that every “by_cases” and its subproof blocks are indented consistently so that Lean’s parser recognizes the bullets as starting subcases.

This approach should eliminate both the unsolved goals and the “unexpected token ‘·’” error.
