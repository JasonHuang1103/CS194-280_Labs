Below is an analysis of the errors and a revised strategy.

──────────────────────────────
1. Identifying Patterns in the Errors

a. Unsatisfied or Unsolved Goals:
 • The error “unsolved goals” indicates that after unfolding the if–else structure, Lean did not automatically solve the inequality/conjunction goals. In other words, some branches of the case analysis were not fully handled by the provided tactics.

b. Unexpected Token Errors (such as “unexpected token '·'; expected command”):
 • This comes from the use (or placement) of bullet symbols (like “·”) in tactic mode. In Lean 4, indentation and bullet syntax must match exactly; a misplaced bullet or one that starts at the wrong indentation level causes a parsing error.

c. Complexity with Nested if–then–else:
 • The nested ifs lead to deeper case analyses that are not “unfolded” interactively. This increases the risk that an if branch remains in the goal instead of being simplified. It also makes tactic application (e.g. using “simp” or “linarith”) less straightforward.

──────────────────────────────
2. What Approach Isn’t Working

a. In the original plan, the proof tries to “unfold” the definition of minOfThree and then uses a nested case analysis. However, the structure of nested if–then–else statements leaves behind “if” expressions that are not automatically removed unless the correct tactics (like simp with proper rewrite rules) and bullet indentation are used.

b. The direct use of nested by_cases without additional tactic support or explicit “match” elimination leaves unsolved subgoals in some branches. In other words, the “by_cases” tactic is used on the condition of an if, but then inner conditions (another if) remain to be dealt with manually in a way that’s prone to indentation errors.

c. The mixture of tactic mode commands without clear separation (for instance, incomplete proofs in a branch) contributes to “unsolved goals” errors.

──────────────────────────────
3. Alternative Implementation Approaches

a. Use Pattern Matching Instead of Nested if–then–else:
 • Instead of writing nested ifs, one can define minOfThree with pattern matching (e.g. using “match” on a result of comparing a and b, etc.). For instance, one might define a helper function that picks the lesser of two numbers and then use it twice. This both shortens the proof and simplifies case analysis.

b. Consolidate Inequality Proofs:
 • Instead of proving each inequality manually in each branch, one can split the goal into two parts—one for the “inequality” part and one for the “membership” part—and use tactics like “linarith” to discharge the inequality conditions.

c. Proper Use of Bullet Notation:
 • Avoid the “unexpected token” errors by making sure that each proof branch begins with an appropriate bullet (or a “–” in Lean 4’s tactic mode) and that the indentation is consistent. Often reindenting or using brackets can help Lean parse the proof correctly.

4. Revised Plan

A. Implementation Revision

Option 1: Using the nested if–then–else (with careful formatting):

  def minOfThree (a : Int) (b : Int) (c : Int) : Int :=
    if a ≤ b then 
      if a ≤ c then a else c
    else 
      if b ≤ c then b else c

This is acceptable if we ensure that our proofs later “unfold” these definitions correctly.

Option 2: (Alternative) Use a helper function that picks the minimum of two numbers, then define

  def min2 (x y : Int) : Int :=
    if x ≤ y then x else y

and then

  def minOfThree (a b c : Int) : Int := min2 (min2 a b) c

This style makes the definition and subsequent proof more modular.

B. Proof Strategy Revision

1. Rather than (or in addition to) unfolding minOfThree completely, consider using simp or dsimp with the lemmas of if–then–else to simplify the goal. For example, rewriting if–then–else with “if_pos” or “if_neg” can help.

2. For nested case analysis, carefully structure the proof with proper bullets. For instance:

  • Do “by_cases h₁ : a ≤ b” at the top level.
  • Inside the h₁ branch, “by_cases h₂ : a ≤ c”, and each branch should be indented and delimited using bullets. Make sure to end each branch with a complete proof or a “sorry” (only temporarily) to avoid unsolved goals.

3. Use tactics like “split” to break the conjunction and “linarith” to resolve the simple inequalities where possible.

4. In each branch, after simplifying by rewriting the if–else, show:
  – The inequality conditions (using facts like Int.le_refl, or converting strict inequality to ≤ with Int.le_of_lt).
  – The membership condition (by using rfl or “left; rfl”, “right; left; rfl”, etc.)

A revised proof skeleton might look like this (using the original nested if definition):

              }
            · exact Int.le_refl c
          · right; right; rfl
---------------------------------------------------------

In this revised proof:
 • Notice the careful use of “with” clauses after by_cases to delimit proofs.
 • Bullets (using “| pos =>” and “| neg =>”) keep the branching clear.
 • Each branch uses “simp only [if_pos …]” or “simp only [if_neg …]” to reduce the if–else.
 • The use of “split” breaks the goal into proving the inequalities and the membership.

C. Final Words

By moving to a pattern–matching style in the proof (using the “with” annotated branches) and being extra careful with tactic indentation and bullet style, we avoid the “unexpected token” issues and unsolved goals. In addition, modularizing the function definition (or at least thinking about using helper functions like min2) can further simplify both implementation and proof.

This revised strategy should address the issues encountered in the previous attempts.
