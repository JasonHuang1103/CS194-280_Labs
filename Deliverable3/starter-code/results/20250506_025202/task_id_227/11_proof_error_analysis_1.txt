Below is a step‐by‐step analysis of what’s going wrong and how to fix it.

──────────────────────────────
1. Identifying the Failing Tactic

The error message complains about an unexpected token “·” (a bullet) and “unsolved goals” in the “case pos” and “case neg” branches. In our proof we use the tactic

  by_cases h₁ : a ≤ b

and then in each branch we “enter” the proof with a bullet (the “·” symbol). Lean is complaining that at one point a bullet is found where Lean expects a tactic command. In other words, the bullet syntax is “mis‐placed” or its indentation isn’t what Lean expects. (The additional “unsolved goals” message tells us that after some tactic sequences further subgoals remain unsolved.)

2. Considering the Proof State at the Failing Point

After the initial “unfold” our goal becomes an equality between a rather complicated “if … then … else …” expression and the specification that consists of a conjunction of inequalities and a disjunction of equalities. The “by_cases h₁ : a ≤ b” then splits this goal into two cases:
 • In the first (h₁ holds) branch the if–expression simplifies to (if a ≤ c then a else c).
 • In the second branch (¬ (a ≤ b)) it simplifies to (if b ≤ c then b else c).

Inside these branches we see further “by_cases” splits (on h₂ and h₃) that add yet more subcases. When adding bullets (using “·”) to mark the beginning of each branch, the indentation must clearly signal to Lean which block a bullet begins. In our code the bullet “·” shows up (for example, on the line “· simp only [if_neg h₃]”) without Lean recognizing that we are still within a proper tactic block. This is why Lean issues “unexpected token ‘·’; expected command.”

3. Does the Proof Approach Match the Specification?

The idea of splitting the proof into cases based on the “if” conditions in minOfThree is entirely reasonable: you must show that in every branch the returned value is (a) lower than or equal to a, b, and c, and (b) equal to one of them. However, the current approach is “brittle” in two ways:
 – The nested by_cases combined with the “if_pos” and “if_neg” rewrites require very careful control of the scope and indentation.
 – The inner subgoals (which originate after using “constructor”) are not all solved by the tactics provided, leaving unsolved subgoals.

4. Looking for Type Mismatches or Incorrect Assumptions

At a glance the arithmetic parts (e.g. using Int.le_of_lt and Int.lt_of_not_ge) are not the main issue (assuming the usual library lemmas are available for Int). There is no obvious type mismatch. Rather the “unsolved goal” error is a symptom of the bullet markers and tactic blocks not “matching up” to the structure given by the by_cases splits. (For example, the tactic “simp only [if_pos h₁]” is expected to simplify the “if” term, but then later in that branch the constructor tactic is called and leaves new subgoals that are never completely discharged.)

──────────────────────────────
5. Considering Alternative Proof Strategies

There are two directions you might take:

 A. Fix the bullet/indentation structure:
  • Ensure that each by_cases is followed by its bullet-marked branches with consistent indentation.
  • If you have nested by_cases, you might want to enclose inner proofs in “begin … end” blocks to make the structure explicit.
  • Alternatively, use the “.cases” tactic or “match … with” constructions to avoid the potential pitfalls of bullet indentation.
 B. Rewrite the proof using explicit rewriting (for example, with “rw [if_pos h₁]” instead of “simp only …”) so that the “if” expressions are simplified uniformly in the goal.
  • This may allow you to prove the goal without relying on bullet structure for case splits.
  • You might also “unfold” more definitions or use “calc” style proofs if that fits your taste.

──────────────────────────────
Conclusion and Root Cause

The root cause is not a mismatch in types or incorrect mathematical assumptions but an issue with the manner in which the case splits are written. The bullet “·” markers (which indicate new tactic blocks) are not aligned properly with the nested structure of the “by_cases” splits. Lean ends up “losing track” of where a branch begins or ends, so that after some tactics there remain unsolved subgoals and an “unexpected token” error occurs when a bullet is encountered at an “illegal” point in the proof.

──────────────────────────────
Suggested Fix

Examine and adjust the indentation so that each bullet appears at the correct indentation level. For example, one change would be to write:

 unfold minOfThree minOfThree_spec
 by_cases h₁ : a ≤ b with
 | pos =>
  rw [if_pos h₁]
  by_cases h₂ : a ≤ c with
  | pos =>
   rw [if_pos h₂]
   -- complete the proof for this branch
  | neg =>
   rw [if_neg h₂]
   -- complete the proof for this branch
 | neg =>
  rw [if_neg h₁]
  by_cases h₃ : b ≤ c with
  | pos =>
   rw [if_pos h₃]
   -- complete the proof
  | neg =>
   rw [if_neg h₃]
   -- complete the proof

Alternatively, if you wish to stick with bullet syntax (“·”) then be careful that the entire block of tactics for each case is indented correctly (or wrapped in “begin … end” blocks) so that Lean can parse them properly.

──────────────────────────────
Final Remarks

In summary, the error comes from using bullet notation (“·”) in a nested by_cases without the proper indentation (and possibly without closing the inner cases cleanly). To fix the issue, rearrange the bullet markers (or switch to other case-analysis syntax) so that Lean sees a complete tactic for each branch and no stray bullets appear where a command is expected.

This should get you on track to successfully complete the proof.
