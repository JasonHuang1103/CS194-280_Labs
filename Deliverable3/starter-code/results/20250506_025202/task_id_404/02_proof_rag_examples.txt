excluded middle. the full list of axioms that are used in lean to support classical reasoning are discussed in axioms and computation. examples of propositional validities lean ' s standard library contains proofs of many valid statements of propositional logic, all of which you are free to use in proofs of your own. the following list includes a number of common identities. commutativity : p ∧ q ↔ q ∧ p p ∨ q ↔ q ∨ p associativity : ( p ∧ q ) ∧ r ↔ p ∧ ( q ∧ r ) ( p ∨ q ) ∨ r ↔ p ∨ ( q ∨ r ) distributivity : p ∧ ( q ∨ r ) ↔ ( p ∧ q ) ∨ ( p ∧ r ) p ∨ ( q ∧ r ) ↔ ( p ∨ q ) ∧ ( p ∨ r ) other properties : ( p → ( q → r ) ) ↔ ( p ∧ q → r ) ( ( p ∨ q ) → r ) ↔ ( p → r ) ∧ ( q → r ) ¬ ( p ∨ q ) ↔ ¬p ∧ ¬q ¬p ∨ ¬q → ¬ ( p ∧ q ) ¬ ( p ∧ ¬p ) p ∧ ¬q → ¬ ( p → q
