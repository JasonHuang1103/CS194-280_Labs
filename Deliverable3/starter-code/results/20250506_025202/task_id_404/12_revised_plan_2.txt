Below is an analysis of the errors together with a revised strategy and plan.

──────────────────────────────
1. Patterns in the errors

• The first error is about unsolved goals in the two cases (when a ≤ b and when a > b). This happens because our tactic proof does not completely discharge all subgoals after the unfolding and case-splitting.
  
• The second error (“unexpected token '·'; expected command”) indicates that Lean did not accept the bullet notation because of indentation or formatting issues. This can happen when the bullet character (·) is either not recognized in the current context or its indentation is off.

──────────────────────────────
2. What approach isn’t working

• Our initial approach using split_ifs inside a single split did not properly structure the proof into separate branches that completely finish each subgoal.  
• The use of bullets (·) seems to be causing an issue because of indentation or formatting (possibly due to copy-pasting from another editor or version differences).  
• In other words, Lean was expecting a tactic command (or correct indentation) but discovered an unexpected bullet marker.

3. Alternative implementation approaches

There are two alternatives to structure the proof:

A. Use split_ifs with careful indentation:
   – First, unfold the definitions.
   – Use "split_ifs" to perform a case analysis on the if-statement.
   – In each branch, further use "split" (or multiple tactic commands) to show both parts of the conjunction.
   – Ensure bullet symbols are used consistently and are at the proper indentation level.

B. Use by_cases to simplify the proof:
   – You can use "by_cases h: a ≤ b" to split into two cases.
   – In the "if" branch (when h holds), show that myMin returns a and all properties follow.
   – In the "else" branch, note that ¬(a ≤ b) gives a > b, so myMin returns b and prove the properties likewise.
   – This approach might bypass some complications with bullet notation.

Both methods are valid; the key is to completely discharge each goal and to be careful with indentation and bullet formatting if you use method A.

4. Revised Plan

Below is a revised plan that addresses both the final implementation and the proof:

Step 1. Implementation remains similar:
  • Define myMin (a : Int) (b : Int) : Int as:
      if a ≤ b then a else b

Step 2. Specification is given as:
  • myMin_spec (a b : Int) (result : Int) : Prop :=
       (result ≤ a ∧ result ≤ b) ∧ (result = a ∨ result = b)

Step 3. Revised Proof Strategy. We offer an example using by_cases:

  • Begin by unfolding definitions.
  • Use "by_cases h: a ≤ b" to consider the two cases.
  • In case h holds:
       – MyMin reduces to a.
       – You show:
           * a ≤ a by reflexivity.
           * a ≤ b by assumption.
           * And the equality part is a = a.
  • In the else case (¬ (a ≤ b)):
       – Note that ¬ (a ≤ b) implies a > b; therefore myMin returns b.
       – Show:
           * b ≤ a (using that a > b gives b ≤ a).
           * b ≤ b by reflexivity.
           * And the equality part is b = b.
  • Conclude using "split" for the conjunction in the specification.

Step 4. Revised Proof Code

You can adopt one of the following styles. (I show style (B) with by_cases here.)

Revised Lean Code Example:

import Mathlib
import Aesop

-- Implementation
def myMin (a : Int) (b : Int) : Int :=
  if a ≤ b then a else b

-- Specification of the function
def myMin_spec (a : Int) (b : Int) (result : Int) : Prop :=
  (result ≤ a ∧ result ≤ b) ∧ (result = a ∨ result = b)

theorem myMin_spec_satisfied (a : Int) (b : Int) :
  myMin_spec a b (myMin a b) :=
by
  -- Unfold definitions to see the conditional
  unfold myMin myMin_spec
  by_cases h : a ≤ b
  · -- Case: a ≤ b, so myMin reduces to a.
    -- Split the conjunctive goal into two parts.
    apply And.intro
    · -- First part: show a ≤ a and a ≤ b.
      exact ⟨le_refl a, h⟩
    · -- Second part: show that the result equals a.
      left
      rfl
  · -- Case: ¬ (a ≤ b), hence a > b. Now myMin reduces to b.
    apply And.intro
    · -- First part: show b ≤ a and b ≤ b.
      -- Since ¬(a ≤ b) implies a > b we can use a standard result:
      have h' : b ≤ a := Int.le_of_lt (Int.lt_of_not_ge h)
      exact ⟨h', le_refl b⟩
    · -- Second part: show that the result equals b.
      right
      rfl

──────────────────────────────
Notes on the Revision:

• The proof uses "by_cases" instead of "split_ifs" to avoid any issues with bullet markers.  
• Each case is clearly separated using a bullet starting with "·" (make sure your editor and Lean version support this notation or replace with begin ... end blocks).  
• In the first branch we use "left" and "rfl" to conclude (a = a) and in the second branch "right" and "rfl" for (b = b).
• We use the helper lemma Int.le_of_lt together with Int.lt_of_not_ge to convert ¬ (a ≤ b) into b ≤ a.

Conclusion

By switching to a by_cases proof and being careful with indentation and bullet usage, we can avoid unsolved goals and unexpected token errors. This revised strategy ensures that the implementation (if–then–else for myMin) and the accompanying proof that myMin satisfies the specification are correctly spelled out in Lean 4.

This revised plan should address the issues encountered with the previous implementation attempts.
