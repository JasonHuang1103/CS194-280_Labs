Below is an analysis of the error patterns together with a revised strategy for both the implementation and the proof. This explanation explains step by step what needs to change and why.

──────────────────────────────
1. Patterns in the Errors

• Unsolved goals in each case indicate that the tactic proof was not fully discharging all required subgoals. In particular, when splitting the goal into two cases corresponding to whether a ≤ b or not, the tactics inside each branch did not completely prove both parts of the conjunction in the specification.
  
• The unexpected token error for '·' (bullet markers) is usually caused by improper or inconsistent indentation. Lean 4 expects either a consistent use of bullet markers or explicit begin…end or braces to enclose tactic blocks.

──────────────────────────────
2. What Approach Isn’t Working

• The initial approach used an if–then–else in the implementation and tried to prove the specification with tactics that split the proof into separate subcases, but the chosen structure (for example, using split_ifs or bullets with an improper indentation) left unsolved subgoals.  
• The bullet marker “·” wasn’t always recognized because of indentation issues or because the proof context did not accept the bullet form. This leads Lean to produce an "unexpected token" error.

3. Alternative Implementation Approaches

There are two primary ways to structure the proof:

A. Use split_ifs with proper indentation:
   – Unfold the definitions and then use split_ifs.
   – In each branch, use “split” to break apart the conjunction and prove each piece.
   – Make sure the bullet notation or indentation is consistent; if using bullets, ensure that each bullet starts at the same indentation level and that its block is correctly structured.

B. Use by_cases:
   – Start by unfolding the definitions.
   – Use by_cases on the hypothesis a ≤ b, which cleanly splits the proof into two cases.
   – In each branch, prove that the result satisfies the two parts of the specification (that the result is ≤ a and ≤ b, and that the result is equal to a or b).  
   – This style often avoids complications such as dealing with nested if–then–else and bullet formatting issues.

4. Revised Plan

Step 1. Implementation  
  • Define the function with a straightforward if–then–else:
  
    def myMin (a : Int) (b : Int) : Int :=
      if a ≤ b then a else b

Step 2. Specification  
  • The specification remains the same:

    def myMin_spec (a : Int) (b : Int) (result : Int) : Prop :=
      (result ≤ a ∧ result ≤ b) ∧ (result = a ∨ result = b)

Step 3. Revised Proof using by_cases (Approach B)  
  • Begin the proof by unfolding definitions.  
  • Use “by_cases h: a ≤ b” to split into two cases.
  • In the “if” branch (when a ≤ b holds):
       – Notice that myMin reduces to a.
       – Prove that a ≤ a (by reflexivity) and a ≤ b (by hypothesis h).
       – For the equality part, conclude a = a.
  • In the “else” branch (when ¬ (a ≤ b)):
       – Note that ¬ (a ≤ b) implies a > b and consequently myMin returns b.
       – Prove that b ≤ a (by converting the inequality) and that b ≤ b (by reflexivity).
       – Then conclude b = b.
  • Use “apply And.intro” (or “split”) to break apart the conjunctions, and in each branch use bullet markers or a clear “begin…end” block with consistent indentation.

Step 4. Revised Proof Code Example

Below is a complete Lean 4 example that follows the revised plan:

---------------------------------------------------
import Mathlib
import Aesop

-- Implementation
def myMin (a : Int) (b : Int) : Int :=
  if a ≤ b then a else b

-- Specification of the function
def myMin_spec (a : Int) (b : Int) (result : Int) : Prop :=
  (result ≤ a ∧ result ≤ b) ∧ (result = a ∨ result = b)

theorem myMin_spec_satisfied (a : Int) (b : Int) :
  myMin_spec a b (myMin a b) :=
by
  -- Unfold the definitions so the underlying if–then–else becomes apparent.
  unfold myMin myMin_spec
  by_cases h : a ≤ b
  · -- Case: a ≤ b, so myMin reduces to a.
    apply And.intro
    · -- Show the first conjunct: a is ≤ a and a ≤ b.
      exact ⟨le_refl a, h⟩
    · -- Show the second conjunct: the result equals a.
      left
      rfl
  · -- Case: ¬ (a ≤ b), so a > b and myMin reduces to b.
    apply And.intro
    · -- Show that b is ≤ a and b is ≤ b.
      -- Convert ¬(a ≤ b) into the fact that a > b and therefore b ≤ a.
      have h' : b ≤ a := Int.le_of_lt (Int.lt_of_not_ge h)
      exact ⟨h', le_refl b⟩
    · -- Show that the result equals b.
      right
      rfl
---------------------------------------------------

Notes on the Revised Code:
• We use the by_cases tactic to clearly split the proof into two cases.  
• In each branch, we use And.intro with proper bullet markers (using "·") that are correctly indented.  
• Alternatively, you could replace the bullets with begin … end blocks to avoid any bullet marker issues, if preferred.  
• The helper functions Int.lt_of_not_ge and Int.le_of_lt are used to convert the negation of a ≤ b into the useful inequality b ≤ a.

Conclusion

The errors arose because the initial proof did not fully discharge all subgoals and the bullet notation (·) was not indented consistently. By switching to a by_cases proof—and carefully splitting each branch with properly indented bullets or using begin…end blocks—we completely prove all required parts of the specification. This revised strategy resolves both the unsolved goals and the unexpected token error while simplifying the structure of the argument.

This revised plan should help you correct and complete your Lean 4 implementation.
