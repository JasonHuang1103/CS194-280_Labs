Below is our detailed reasoning process and final plan.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Understand the function’s purpose

• The function myMin takes two integers a and b and must return the smaller one.  
• When a is less than or equal to b, myMin should return a; otherwise, it returns b.  
• In both cases, the returned result is guaranteed to be less than or equal to each input and is equal to one of them.

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Break down the problem

• Implementation:  
  – We can use Lean’s "if ... then ... else ..." construct.  
  – The function will be defined as: if a ≤ b then a else b.

• Specification:  
  – We have the predicate myMin_spec a b result that expresses two parts:  
    1. result ≤ a ∧ result ≤ b  
    2. result = a ∨ result = b  

• Proof:  
  – We need to show that myMin a b satisfies the specification.  
  – This can be broken into two cases based on the condition in the if-statement:  
    • Case 1: Assume a ≤ b. Then myMin a b simplifies to a.  
      • We must show: a ≤ a and a ≤ b, plus that result equals a.  
      • The first part is trivial (reflexivity), while the second holds by our assumption.
    • Case 2: Assume ¬ (a ≤ b). Then myMin a b simplifies to b.  
      • Here, we have that a > b so that b ≤ a holds by properties of integers, and obviously b ≤ b.  
      • Also, result equals b in this branch.

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. Consider input types, edge cases, & behavior

• Inputs are of type Int. Lean’s Int supports the ≤ and > relations properly.
• The function correctly handles the edge case when a equals b, since then a ≤ b holds and myMin returns a (which is also b).

──────────────────────────────
Step 4. Proof techniques

• We will use a tactic proof and perform a case split using either "by_cases" or "split_ifs" after unfolding definitions.
• For each case, we “split” the goal into proving:
  – The inequality part: result ≤ a and result ≤ b.
  – The equality part: result equals either a or b.
• Tactics like "split", "apply", and "rfl" (or "exact") will be used.

──────────────────────────────
Step 5. Plan outline and similar patterns

• Similar Lean proofs use “if ... then ... else ...” and perform case analysis with "split_ifs" or "by_cases".
• Our plan is to:
  1. Define myMin using the if-then-else construct.
  2. Write the specification predicate myMin_spec.
  3. Unfold definitions in the theorem myMin_spec_satisfied.
  4. Use "split_ifs" or "by_cases" to consider both conditions:
     - When a ≤ b: Prove that a ≤ a (trivial) and a ≤ b, also that result = a.
     - When a > b: Prove that b ≤ a (by the ordering properties of Int) and b ≤ b (trivial), and that result = b.
  5. Close the proof using basic tactics.

Final Detailed Plan

1. Implementation:
   • Define myMin (a : Int) (b : Int) : Int as follows:
     if a ≤ b then a else b

2. Specification:
   • Define myMin_spec (a b : Int) (result : Int) : Prop as:
     (result ≤ a ∧ result ≤ b) ∧ (result = a ∨ result = b)

3. Proof (theorem myMin_spec_satisfied):
   • Unfold the definitions of myMin and myMin_spec.
   • Perform a case analysis using "split_ifs":  
     – In the “if” branch (when a ≤ b), show:
         ◦ a ≤ a is trivial,
         ◦ a ≤ b holds by assumption,
         ◦ And result is a.
     – In the “else” branch (when ¬ (a ≤ b)), show:
         ◦ Since ¬ (a ≤ b) implies a > b, we get b ≤ a,
         ◦ b ≤ b is trivial,
         ◦ And result is b.
   • Use splits and tactics like "split", "rfl" (reflexivity), and "left/right" to finish the proof.
