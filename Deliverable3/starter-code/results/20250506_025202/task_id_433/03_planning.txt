Below is our step‐by‐step analysis and plan for both writing the function and proving its specification.

──────────────────────────────
1. Understand the Function’s Goal

• We need a function isGreater that takes an integer n and an array a of integers.
• It must return true exactly when “n is strictly greater than every element in a.”
• In other words, the Boolean result should be true if for every valid index i (i < a.size) we have n > a[i]! and false if there exists even one index for which n ≤ a[i]! (or n = a[i]!).

──────────────────────────────
2. Break Down the Problem

Here we have two main parts:
(a) Implementation: Write a Lean 4 function that “folds” over the array checking the predicate (λ x, n > x). Lean’s array library provides functions (for example, all? or forall?) that can help.
(b) Proof: Prove the theorem that ties the Boolean result from isGreater with the formal proposition (∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!) using a logical equivalence.

──────────────────────────────
3. Consider Input Types, Edge Cases, and Expected Behavior

• Input types: n is an Int and a is an Array of Int. Both are non-null; the array can even be empty.
• Edge case: If a is empty, then “n is greater than every element in a” holds vacuously. Our function should therefore return true.
• Expected behavior: Using a predicate (λ x, n > x) combined with a function like a.all? works naturally since it returns true exactly when the predicate holds for every element.

──────────────────────────────
4. Proof Techniques

For the proof we need to show that:
  (∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!) ↔ result
where result is defined as isGreater n a.

Plan for the proof:
• Unfold the definitions of isGreater and our specification isGreater_spec.
• Notice that our implementation will use a.all? (λ x, n > x). The standard property of all? (or its variant when applied to a.toList) is that:
  a.all? (λ x, n > x) = true  ↔  ∀ x ∈ a.toList, n > x
• Since every element of a appears in a.toList, the property “∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!” is equivalent to “∀ x ∈ a.toList, n > x.”
• Therefore, we can use these standard equivalences (possibly via existing lemmas or by a short induction on the list) to complete the proof.
• Most likely the proof will involve rewriting the definition of Array.all? in terms of a.toList and then appealing to a standard lemma like list.all_iff_forall_mem.

──────────────────────────────
5. Similar Patterns from Examples

• The brief excerpt from the Lean 4 documentation shows using auxiliary recursive functions and pattern-matching. Although we can simply use the built-in all?, the strategy of “unfold/rewrite” will also appear in the proof.
• The structure of the theorem statement and its proof mimics many “specification satisfied by the implementation” proofs in Lean.

Detailed Implementation and Proof Plan

A. Implementation plan:

We choose to define isGreater as:
  def isGreater (n : Int) (a : Array Int) : Bool :=
    a.all? (fun x => n > x)
This uses the Array.all? function which returns true when (n > x) holds for every x in a.

B. Proof plan:

We need to prove:
  theorem isGreater_spec_satisfied (n : Int) (a : Array Int) :
    isGreater_spec n a (isGreater n a)
where
  isGreater_spec n a result := (∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!) ↔ result.

Steps in the proof:
1. Unfold the definitions of isGreater and isGreater_spec.
2. Show that
  (∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!) ↔ a.all? (λ x, n > x)
3. Convert a.all? (λ x, n > x) to a property about a.toList using the standard fact:
  a.all? p = true ↔ ∀ x ∈ a.toList, p x
4. Note that the property “∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]! ” and “∀ x ∈ a.toList, n > x” are equivalent (since a.toList is precisely the elements of a).
5. Complete the proof by applying transitivity of the equivalence.

This plan may require either citing a standard lemma from the Lean library relating Array.all? and List.all or (if necessary) proving a small helper lemma.

Final Code Outline

Below is the complete Lean 4 code following our plan:

------------------------------------------------
import Mathlib
import Aesop

-- Implementation
def isGreater (n : Int) (a : Array Int) : Bool :=
  -- << CODE START >>
  a.all? (fun x => n > x)
  -- << CODE END >>

-- Specification: n is strictly greater than every element in a if and only if the result is true.
def isGreater_spec (n : Int) (a : Array Int) (result : Bool) : Prop :=
  -- << SPEC START >>
  (∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!) ↔ result
  -- << SPEC END >>

-- Theorem: isGreater satisfies its specification.
theorem isGreater_spec_satisfied (n : Int) (a : Array Int) :
  isGreater_spec n a (isGreater n a) := by
  -- << PROOF START >>
  -- Unfold the definitions.
  unfold isGreater isGreater_spec
  -- Our goal is now to prove:
  -- (∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!) ↔ a.all? (fun x => n > x)
  --
  -- We use the correspondence between Array.all? and the property on the list of elements.
  have h : a.all? (fun x => n > x) = true ↔ ∀ x ∈ a.toList, n > x :=
  begin
    -- This follows by the definition of Array.all? in terms of the list representation.
    exact Array.all?_eq_all _ a,
  end,
  -- Also, note that ∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]! is equivalent to ∀ x ∈ a.toList, n > x.
  have h' : (∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!) ↔ ∀ x ∈ a.toList, n > x,
  begin
    apply Iff.intro,
    { intro H,
      intros x hx,
      -- Since each x in a.toList comes from some index i < a.size, we can obtain such an index.
      obtain ⟨i, hi, rfl⟩ := Array.mem_toList.mp hx,
      exact H i hi, },
    { intro H,
      intros i hi,
      have : a[i]! ∈ a.toList := Array.mem_toList.mpr ⟨i, hi, rfl⟩,
      exact H (a[i]!) this, }
  end,
  -- Now by rewriting using h and h' we obtain the desired equivalence.
  rw [h', h],
  simp,
  -- << PROOF END >>

------------------------------------------------

Notes:
• In the above proof, we used two auxiliary facts:
  – Array.all?_eq_all : a lemma stating that a.all? (p) = true is equivalent to ∀ x ∈ a.toList, p x.
  – Array.mem_toList: A lemma that relates membership in a.toList and the existence of an index in the array.
• If these lemmas are not already available in your Lean 4 library, they can be proved by induction on the length of the array (or by converting the array to a list and using standard list lemmas).

Conclusion

We first analyzed what is required:
 – The function isGreater should return true exactly when every element in the array is less than n.
Based on this, we implemented isGreater using array.all? with our predicate.
Then for the proof, we planned to relate the Boolean test a.all? (λ x, n > x) with the formal condition (∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!) by converting the array to its list representation and applying well‐known correspondences.
This detailed plan both implements and proves the specification in Lean 4.
