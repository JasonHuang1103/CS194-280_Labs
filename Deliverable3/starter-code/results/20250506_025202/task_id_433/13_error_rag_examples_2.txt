debugging a proof, or trying to understand a cryptic error message. too much information can be overwhelming, though, and lean ' s defaults are generally sufficient for ordinary interactions. using the library to use lean effectively you will inevitably need to make use of definitions and theorems in the library. recall that the import command at the beginning of a file imports previously compiled results from other files, and that importing is transitive ; if you import foo and foo imports bar, then the definitions and theorems from bar are available to you as well. but the act of opening a namespace, which provides shorter names, does not carry over. in each file, you need to open the namespaces you wish to use. in general, it is important for you to be familiar with the library and its contents, so you know what theorems, definitions, notations, and resources are available to you. below we will see that lean ' s editor modes can also help you find things you need, but studying the contents of the library directly is often unavoidable. lean ' s standard library can be found online, on github : https : / / github. com / leanprover / lean4 / tree / master / src
