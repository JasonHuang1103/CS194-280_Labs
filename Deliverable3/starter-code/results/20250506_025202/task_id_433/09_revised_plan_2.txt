Below is an analysis of the errors you encountered together with a revised strategy for both the implementation and the proof.

──────────────────────────────
1. Patterns in the Errors

• The error “invalid field 'all?', the environment does not contain 'Array.all?'” tells us that Lean’s Array type does not automatically provide a member function called all?.
• The code attempted to call a.all? (fun x => n > x) directly on an Array, but no such field exists in the Lean 4 Array API.
• (In addition, there may be issues later when trying to relate Boolean tests on arrays to the quantified specification, if the correspondence between the array representation and its list conversion isn’t made explicit.)

──────────────────────────────
2. What Approach Isn’t Working

• The original plan relied on an Array.all? function that does not exist. (It seems the Lean 4 library does provide an all? method for lists rather than for arrays.)
• The proof plan assumed a known lemma (Array.all?_eq_all) that rewrites a.all? (p) = true into ∀ x ∈ a.toList, p x. Since the Array.all? function isn’t available, that lemma doesn’t work as stated.
• Thus, both the implementation and the proof rely on an unavailable function and its associated lemmas.

3. Alternative Implementation Approaches

A. Use the Array’s List Conversion
  • Instead of calling a.all? directly on the Array, convert the array to a list using a.toList and then use a list version of all? that checks the predicate on every element.
  • For example, if Lean’s standard library does not already provide List.all? (or List.all), you can define it recursively:
    def List.all? {α : Type} (p : α → Bool) : List α → Bool
    | []       => true
    | (x::xs)  => p x && List.all? p xs
  • Then, define isGreater by passing (n > ·) to this function on a.toList:
    def isGreater (n : Int) (a : Array Int) : Bool := (a.toList).all? (fun x => n > x)
  • This guarantees that when a is empty the result is true (vacuously) and that otherwise every element is checked.

B. Alternatively, Implement a Fold or Manual Recursion
  • It’s also possible to write an array-folding function that checks the predicate on every element.
  • However, converting to a list is the simplest approach given that the specification already involves the conversion (via a.toList).

4. Revised Plan

[A] Revised Implementation

• Remove the direct use of a.all? so that the implementation works with the available array API.
• Convert the array to a list and then use a list-all helper. For example:

------------------------------------------------
import Mathlib
import Aesop

/-- (Optional) Define list version of all? if not already available. -/
def List.all? {α : Type} (p : α → Bool) : List α → Bool
| []       => true
| (x::xs)  => p x && List.all? p xs

/-- Implementation: Check whether n is strictly greater than all elements in a -/
def isGreater (n : Int) (a : Array Int) : Bool :=
  (a.toList).all? (fun x => n > x)
------------------------------------------------

[B] Revised Proof Approach

• Our specification still says that n is greater than every element (∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!) if and only if the Boolean result is true.
• The proof will need to bridge between the array’s natural predicate and the list’s predicate. Specifically, you’ll need to show that:
  (∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!) ↔ ∀ x ∈ a.toList, n > x
• Then, prove that (a.toList).all? (fun x => n > x) = true ↔ ∀ x ∈ a.toList, n > x.
  • If Lean already provides a lemma like List.all?_iff_forall (or if you have defined List.all? as above), you can use that.
• Finally, rewrite the goal equivalently to complete the proof.

A complete outline of the proof might look like this:

------------------------------------------------
-- Specification: n is strictly greater than every element in a if and only if the result is true.
def isGreater_spec (n : Int) (a : Array Int) (result : Bool) : Prop :=
  (∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!) ↔ result

-- Theorem: isGreater satisfies its specification.
theorem isGreater_spec_satisfied (n : Int) (a : Array Int) :
  isGreater_spec n a (isGreater n a) := by
  -- Unfold definitions.
  unfold isGreater isGreater_spec,
  -- We want to show:
  -- (∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!) ↔ (a.toList).all? (fun x => n > x)
  -- Step 1: Show that ∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]! is equivalent to ∀ x ∈ a.toList, n > x.
  have h₁ : (∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!) ↔ (∀ x ∈ a.toList, n > x) :=
  by
    apply Iff.intro;
    { intro H,
      intros x hx,
      obtain ⟨i, hi, rfl⟩ := Array.mem_toList.mp hx,
      exact H i hi, },
    { intro H,
      intros i hi,
      have mem : a[i]! ∈ a.toList := Array.mem_toList.mpr ⟨i, hi, rfl⟩,
      exact H (a[i]!) mem, },
  -- Step 2: Use a lemma relating (a.toList).all? with the universal property.
  have h₂ : ((a.toList).all? (fun x => n > x)) = true ↔ (∀ x ∈ a.toList, n > x) :=
  begin
    -- If such a lemma exists in your library, use it. Otherwise, prove by induction on a.toList.
    sorry,  -- Replace with the appropriate proof or lemma application.
  end,
  -- Now combine h₁ and h₂.
  rw [h₁, h₂],
  simp,
------------------------------------------------

• If List.all? and Array.mem_toList (which shows the correspondence between an index and membership in a.toList) are not available as built-ins, you will need to prove them by induction.
• The essential idea is to relate indices of a with the elements obtained from a.toList.

5. Conclusion and Summary of Changes

• In the implementation, we no longer assume Array.all? exists. Instead, we convert the array to a list and use a lemma/definition that evaluates whether every element satisfies the predicate (n > x).
• In the proof, we first show that the universal property over indices is equivalent to the universal property over the list representation. Then we relate the Boolean value of (a.toList).all? (fun x => n > x) to that universal property.
• This revised plan avoids relying on non-existent array fields and aligns well with Lean’s standard library functions.

By following this revised strategy, your Lean 4 code should compile and the proof should go through (after filling in or proving any necessary helper lemmas such as the correspondence between List.all? and ∀ x ∈ a.toList, n > x).
