Below is an analysis of the error patterns and a revised strategy for both your implementation and proof.

──────────────────────────────
1. Patterns in the Errors

• The message “invalid field 'all?', the environment does not contain 'Array.all?'” tells us that Lean’s Array type has no method called all?.  
• A similar error appears for List.all? if you try to call it directly on a.toList.  
• In your proof, you assumed there is an easy correspondence (via a lemma like List.all?_iff_forall) that automatically bridges the Boolean test on a list and the universal quantification over its elements—but such a lemma isn’t provided out-of-the-box.

──────────────────────────────
2. What Approach Isn’t Working

• Your first attempt tried to use a.all? on an Array, which fails because there is no such field on Array.  
• Your second attempt converts the array to a list and then calls all? on that list. However, Lean does not have a built-in List.all? (or if it exists, it is not accessible in your current context) so you still get an error.  
• In the proof, you expected to use a preexisting correspondence lemma that relates (a.toList).all? (fun x => n > x) to the proposition ∀ x ∈ a.toList, n > x. Without that lemma (or without defining List.all? yourself), the proof cannot automatically connect your implementation with the spec.

3. Alternative Implementation Approaches

A. Use the Array’s List Conversion with a Helper Predicate  
  • Define your own recursive function (say List.all?) that checks if all elements of a list satisfy a Boolean predicate.  
  • Then define isGreater by converting the array into a list and applying your helper:  
    isGreater n a = (a.toList).all? (fun x => n > x)

B. Prove the Boolean–Proposition Correspondence for List.all?  
  • In the proof, you then need to prove or invoke a lemma stating that:  
    (a.toList).all? (fun x => n > x) = true ↔ (∀ x ∈ a.toList, n > x)  
  • Also show the equivalence between the indexed predicate (∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!) and (∀ x ∈ a.toList, n > x), using the fact that conversion from array to list preserves membership.

4. Revised Plan

[A] Revised Implementation

• Define a helper function List.all? if it is not already available. For example, you can write:
  
  def List.all? {α : Type} (p : α → Bool) : List α → Bool
  | []       => true
  | (x::xs)  => p x && List.all? p xs

• Then implement isGreater by converting the array to a list:
  
  def isGreater (n : Int) (a : Array Int) : Bool :=
    (a.toList).all? (fun x => n > x)

• This revised implementation avoids the non-existent Array.all? and uses only the available conversion and your own defined list function.

[B] Revised Proof Approach

• Your specification is that:  
  (∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!) ↔ (result)  
  with result = (a.toList).all? (fun x => n > x).

• In the proof, break the task in steps:

  1. Prove the equivalence between the indexed formulation:
    ∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!
  and the list formulation:
    ∀ x ∈ a.toList, n > x.
    Use the fact that every element of a is in a.toList (via Array.mem_toList) and vice versa.

  2. Prove the equivalence:
    (a.toList).all? (fun x => n > x) = true ↔ (∀ x ∈ a.toList, n > x)
  This can be done by proving a lemma (by induction on the list) for your definition of List.all?.

  3. Combine the two equivalences so that:
    (∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!) ↔ ((a.toList).all? (fun x => n > x)) = true

  4. Since your isGreater is defined as (a.toList).all? (fun x => n > x), the specification holds.

• A sketch of the proof might look like this:
 
 unfold isGreater isGreater_spec
 have h₁ : (∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!) ↔ (∀ x ∈ a.toList, n > x) := 
  { prove this using Array.mem_toList } 
 have h₂ : ((a.toList).all? (fun x => n > x)) = true ↔ (∀ x ∈ a.toList, n > x) :=
  { prove by induction on a.toList (or use a corresponding library lemma) }
 rw [h₁, h₂]
 simp

5. Summary of Changes

• Implementation:  
 – Remove any use of Array.all?.  
 – Define a custom List.all? that recursively checks the predicate.  
 – Define isGreater by converting the array (a) to a list and applying your List.all? function.

• Proof:  
 – Show that the property “all elements satisfy n > x” is equivalent when stated over indices in the array and when stated over the list obtained via a.toList.  
 – Provide (or prove by induction) a lemma ensuring that (a.toList).all? (fun x => n > x) = true is equivalent to ∀ x ∈ a.toList, n > x.  
 – Combine these equivalences to conclude that isGreater satisfies the specified property.

Following the revised plan should address the errors you encountered and provide a clear path to both implement the function correctly and to complete the accompanying proof in Lean 4.
