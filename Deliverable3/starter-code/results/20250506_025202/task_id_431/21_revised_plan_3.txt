Below is an analysis of the errors you encountered along with a revised strategy for both the implementation and the proof.

──────────────────────────────
1. Patterns in the Errors

• The primary complaints from Lean are unsolved goals during the proof of the “if and only if” statement. In particular, the proof needs to show:

  (∃ i j, i < a.size ∧ j < b.size ∧ a[i]! = b[j]!) ↔ a.any (λ x, b.any (λ y, x = y)) = true

 but Lean cannot directly “invert” the Boolean discussion because no known lemma relates Array.any to an existential statement.

• There are also syntax errors such as “unexpected token '·'” which imply that the bullet notation was either misused or that Lean expects a different style (for example, avoiding bullet symbols altogether or using “begin … end” blocks).

──────────────────────────────
2. What Approach Isn’t Working

• The current approach “unfolds” the predicate inside Array.any and tries to directly apply a lemma like “Array.any_iff”. But such a lemma is not provided by Mathlib out of the box. The intended equivalence (between a.any p = true and ∃ i, i < a.size ∧ p (a[i]!) = true) needs a helper lemma that you must prove first.

• The use of bullet notation (like “·”) is causing mechanical issues. Lean 4 accepts bullet proofs but if not used properly (or if you mix other tactic styles) then unexpected tokens may arise.

3. Alternative Implementation Approaches

A. Implementation

The one-liner

  a.any (fun x => b.any (fun y => x = y))

is perfectly acceptable. (In Lean 4 you can use λ or fun interchangeably.) Its semantics already covers the specification because if either array is empty then no common element exists, and any nonempty array with no witness always returns false.

B. Proof Approach

Two main alternatives are available to prove the specification:

1. Define and prove your own helper lemma (or two) that precisely characterizes when Array.any returns true, i.e.

  lemma array_any_iff {α : Type} (a : Array α) (p : α → Bool) :
  a.any p = true ↔ ∃ i, i < a.size ∧ p (a[i]!) = true

  A similar lemma can be applied to b.any. Use these lemmas to “extract” indices witnessing the common element.

2. Alternatively, convert arrays to lists and use list lemmas (if available) to prove similar properties. However, this may introduce extra overhead in proving that the conversion preserves the index relations you need.

The recommended path is the first option: establish the necessary basic equivalences for Array.any.

4. Revised Plan Addressing the Issues

A. Revised Implementation

Use a clear and succinct implementation:

--------------------------------------------------
import Mathlib
import Aesop

def hasCommonElement (a : Array Int) (b : Array Int) : Bool :=
  a.any (fun x => b.any (fun y => x = y))
--------------------------------------------------

B. Revised Proof Strategy

Step 1. Prove a helper lemma that characterizes the behavior of Array.any. For example:

--------------------------------------------------
lemma array_any_iff {α : Type} (a : Array α) (p : α → Bool) :
  a.any p = true ↔ ∃ i, i < a.size ∧ p (a[i]!) = true :=
by
  induction a.size with
  | zero =>
    simp [Array.any]  -- For an empty array the left-hand side is false
    apply Iff.intro
    · intro h; exfalso; simp at h
    · intro h; cases h with i hi; simp at hi; contradiction
  | succ n ih =>
    -- You may decompose a using Array.uncons? Or consider rewriting the definition
    sorry
--------------------------------------------------

Build a similar or derived lemma for the inner b.any when needed.

Step 2. Use the helper lemma in your main theorem. The overall goal is to prove:

  (∃ i j, i < a.size ∧ j < b.size ∧ a[i]! = b[j]!) ↔ a.any (λ x, b.any (λ y, x = y)) = true

A possible outline is as follows:

--------------------------------------------------
theorem hasCommonElement_spec_satisfied (a : Array Int) (b : Array Int) :
  (∃ i j, i < a.size ∧ j < b.size ∧ a[i]! = b[j]!) ↔
    hasCommonElement a b :=
by
  -- Unfold the definition of hasCommonElement:
  unfold hasCommonElement
  apply Iff.intro
  · -- Forward direction:
    intro h
    rcases h with ⟨i, j, hi, hj, h_eq⟩
    -- Show that using i as a witness for the outer any and j for the inner.
    have hb : b.any (fun y => a[i]! = y) = true, from
      by
        -- Use the helper lemma for b.any:
        have : ∃ j, j < b.size ∧ (a[i]! = b[j]!),
          from ⟨j, hj, h_eq⟩,
        exact (array_any_iff b (fun y => a[i]! = y)).mpr this,
    have ha : a.any (fun x => b.any (fun y => x = y)) = true, from
      by
        -- Use the helper lemma for a.any by choosing x = a[i] and using hb
        have : ∃ i, i < a.size ∧ (b.any (fun y => a[i]! = y)) = true,
          from ⟨i, hi, hb⟩,
        exact (array_any_iff a (fun x => b.any (fun y => x = y))).mpr this,
    exact ha
  · -- Reverse direction:
    intro H
    rcases (array_any_iff a (fun x => b.any (fun y => x = y))).mp H with ⟨i, hi, h_inner⟩
    rcases (array_any_iff b (fun y => a[i]! = y)).mp h_inner with ⟨j, hj, h_eq⟩
    exact ⟨i, j, hi, hj, h_eq⟩
--------------------------------------------------

Step 3. Syntax and Style Improvements

• Replace the problematic bullet “·” style with either proper indentations or use the begin/end block if needed. Alternatively, ensure that the bullet style you use is supported in your Lean 4 setup.

• Replace any “decide (x = y)” (or lambda forms that might force decisions) with plain equality checks if that suits your proof, keeping the coercion between Bool and Prop clear.

Conclusion

To sum up, the needed changes are:

1. Write a concise implementation using a.any (λ x, b.any (λ y, x = y)).
2. Prove a helper lemma (array_any_iff) that shows the equivalence between a.any p = true and the existence of an index i with p (a[i]!) = true. This is essential because there is no built-in lemma for arrays (unlike lists).
3. Use that helper lemma to break up the proof in two directions (→ and ←) so that you can extract the witnesses (indices) from the boolean statements.
4. Adjust your use of bullet notation to ensure that Lean 4’s parser accepts the tactic script. If you run into issues with “·”, consider replacing them with traditional tactic blocks.

Following this revised plan will help you eliminate the unsolved goals and syntax errors, ultimately providing a verified specification for hasCommonElement.
