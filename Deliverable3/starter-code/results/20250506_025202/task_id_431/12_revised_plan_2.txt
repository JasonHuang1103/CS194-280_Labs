Below is an analysis of the errors and a revised strategy addressing both the implementation and the proof.

──────────────────────────────
1. Identifying Patterns in the Errors

• Many errors come from “unsolved goals” in the proof. For example:
  “unsolved goals
   case mp: … ⊢ (∃ i j, i < a.size ∧ j < b.size ∧ a[i]! = b[j]!) → …”
  This indicates that when unfolding the definition of “any” in the forward direction, Lean does not automatically know the equivalence between a.any p = true and “there is an index i with p (a[i]!) = true.”

• You also see a syntax error “unexpected token '·'” which typically occurs when Lean’s bullet (or “•”) style is misapplied (or when Lean expects a command rather than a bullet).

• In short, the proof strategy uses lemmas (such as an “Array.any_iff”) that either do not exist in Mathlib as stated or are not imported/available.

──────────────────────────────
2. Determining What Approach Isn’t Working

• The current plan tries to “unfold” the implementation (i.e. the nested any calls) and then apply a direct equivalence (“Array.any_iff”) to relate the Boolean value to the existence of indices.
  – However, Lean’s standard library may not provide an “Array.any_iff” lemma.
  – Furthermore, the bullet notation “·” is misused, which interrupts the tactic script.

• This means that trying to rely directly on “any_iff” is not working; the extraction of an index that witnesses the predicate’s truth is not “automatic” without an intermediate helper lemma.

──────────────────────────────
3. Alternative Implementation Approaches

a. Implementation Change:
  It turns out that the implementation using
    a.any (fun x => b.any (fun y => x = y))
  is valid. (Some authors prefer to write “λ” instead of “fun”, but both are acceptable.) You might also consider:
    def hasCommonElement (a b : Array Int) : Bool := a.any (λ x => b.any (λ y => x = y))
  which is succinct and handles empty arrays automatically.

b. Proof Change:
  Instead of “unfolding” an unavailable lemma, you have two choices:
   • Define and prove your own helper lemma analogous to “Array.any_iff” that explains:
    For any array a and predicate p, a.any p = true if and only if ∃ i, i < a.size ∧ p (a[i]!) = true.
   • Alternatively, reduce the arrays to lists (using a.toList) where a similar “List.any_iff” might be available. (That strategy may require proving that the conversion preserves the required existence properties.)

  I recommend the first option—introduce a helper lemma (or two, one for a and one for b) so that you can “extract” witnesses for a.any and b.any.
  For example:
    lemma array_any_iff {α : Type} (a : Array α) (p : α → Bool) :
      a.any p = true ↔ ∃ i, i < a.size ∧ p (a[i]!) = true := by
      -- (Proof induction on the array; this lemma can be proved by induction on a.size.)
      sorry

4. Revised Plan Addressing the Issues

A. Revised Implementation

Keep the implementation simple:
--------------------------------------------------
import Mathlib
import Aesop

def hasCommonElement (a : Array Int) (b : Array Int) : Bool :=
  a.any (fun x => b.any (fun y => x = y))
--------------------------------------------------

This one-liner is correct and concise.

B. Revised Proof Strategy

Step 1. Prove a helper lemma. For example, prove a lemma that explains how “any” works over arrays:
--------------------------------------------------
lemma array_any_iff {α : Type} (a : Array α) (p : α → Bool) :
  a.any p = true ↔ ∃ i, i < a.size ∧ p (a[i]!) = true :=
by
  -- Proceed by induction on a.size or by using the definition of Array.any.
  sorry
--------------------------------------------------

(You might need to implement a similar lemma for the inner call on b, or apply the helper lemma twice.)

Step 2. In the specification proof, use the helper lemma. The high-level plan is to show:
  a.any (fun x => b.any (fun y => x = y)) = true ↔
  ∃ i, i < a.size ∧ (∃ j, j < b.size ∧ a[i]! = b[j]!)
Proceed by splitting the proof into two implications, using tactic “apply Iff.intro” (or “constructor”) and then “intro” to obtain the witness. For example:

--------------------------------------------------
theorem hasCommonElement_spec_satisfied (a : Array Int) (b : Array Int) :
  ((∃ i j, i < a.size ∧ j < b.size ∧ a[i]! = b[j]!) ↔
    hasCommonElement a b) :=
by
  -- Unfold the definition
  unfold hasCommonElement
  apply Iff.intro
  · -- Forward direction:
    intro h
    rcases h with ⟨i, j, hi, hj, h_eq⟩
    -- Apply the helper lemma on b.any to rewrite it as an existence statement.
    -- Then use the helper lemma on a.any.
    -- For example:
    have hb : b.any (fun y => a[i]! = y) = true, from
      -- Show that using index j in b works since b[j]! = a[i]!
      by
        -- Use the helper lemma for b
        sorry,
    have ha : a.any (fun x => b.any (fun y => x = y)) = true, from
      -- Use the helper lemma for a by witnessing index i
      by
        sorry,
    exact ha
  · -- Reverse direction:
    intro H
    -- Use the helper lemma on a.any to extract an index i that witnesses that b.any returns true.
    rcases (array_any_iff a (fun x => b.any (fun y => x = y))).mp H with ⟨i, hi, h_inner⟩
    -- Now extract an index j using the helper lemma on b.any.
    rcases (array_any_iff b (fun y => a[i]! = y)).mp h_inner with ⟨j, hj, h_eq⟩
    exact ⟨i, j, hi, hj, h_eq⟩
--------------------------------------------------

Note: The “sorry” markers remain where a detailed low‐level proof is needed. Once the helper lemma is proved, the “sorry” blocks in this proof can be replaced by complete arguments.

Step 3. Syntax Considerations

• Replace bullet “·” or “•” with tactics that Lean 4 accepts. In Lean 4, the use of “by” blocks, “rcases” and “intro” is common. If bullet style causes troubles, simply use indentation or “begin … end” blocks.

Conclusion

• The errors indicate that the extraction of witnesses from Array.any (via an “any_iff” lemma) was not directly available and that bullet notation was misused.
• The alternative strategy is to write a helper lemma (or two) that establishes the equivalence between a.any returning true and the existence of an index with the required property.
• With the helper lemma in place, you then prove the specification by applying these lemmas for the outer and inner arrays.
• Finally, adjust the tactic style (avoiding problematic bullets) to ensure compatibility with Lean 4.

This revised plan should guide you to a working implementation and proof once the helper lemma and the detailed subproofs are filled in.
