Below is a step‐by‐step analysis of the proof error:

─────────────────────────────  
1. Failing tactic and its reason

The error message complains about unsolved goals for the statement

  ∀ i < a.size, (Array.map (λ x => x * x * x) a)[i]! = a[i]! * a[i]! * a[i]!

even though the proof script simply executes

  intro i h  
  rfl

The problem is that the theorem’s statement is a conjunction (an “∧” statement) with two parts: one asserting that the sizes are equal and the other asserting the elementwise equality. In the given proof the tactics after “simp” do not split the goal into its two conjuncts. (That is, no tactic like split or constructor is used.) As a result the proof continues trying to prove the whole conjunction, and then the “intro i h” applies only to one part leaving the other still unsolved.  

─────────────────────────────  
2. The proof state at that point

When you use “unfold” and “simp [Array.size_map, Array.getElem_map, Function.comp]”, Lean simplifies the goal to something like

  (a.map (λ x => x * x * x)).size = a.size ∧  
  ∀ i, i < a.size → (a.map (λ x => x * x * x))[i]! = a[i]! * a[i]! * a[i]!

At that moment, instead of having two separate subgoals (one for each conjunct) the proof script is still handling the conjunction as one goal. Then executing “intro i h” targets the second conjunct and leaves the first unsolved. This is why Lean complains about unsolved goals.

─────────────────────────────  
3. Matching the proof approach to the specification

The specification (named cubeElements_spec) is an “and” of two properties:
 • The length preservation property, and  
 • The elementwise equality property.

Your approach works if you show each conjunct separately. However, your tactic sequence does not “split” the conjunction into separate subgoals to handle them one at a time.

─────────────────────────────  
4. Type mismatches and incorrect assumptions

There is no type mismatch in the mathematical sense. The “unexpected identifier; expected command” error appears because once a goal is completely solved, the subsequent “intro i h” is parsed to act on a non-existent or unexpected goal state. In other words, the issue is not with the types but with the order and method of decomposing the conjunction. The proof script mistakenly assumes that “simp” or later tactics will automatically handle both conjuncts.

─────────────────────────────  
5. Alternative proof strategies

A common remedy is to decompose a conjunction using a tactic such as split. For instance, you could write:
  split  
  · simp [Array.size_map]  
  · intro i h  
    simp [Array.getElem_map]  
    rfl

Alternatively, you could use “simp_all” after the unfold command so that both subgoals get simplified automatically. The key is to direct Lean’s tactic state so that it sees the two separate parts of the conjunction.

─────────────────────────────  
Conclusion and root cause

The root cause of the error is that the proof does not split the goal (the conjunction) before trying to introduce an index on one of the conjuncts. Only one of the conjunction’s parts gets addressed, leaving the other unsolved. Lean then complains about “unsolved goals,” and when it later sees an unexpected identifier the parsing of commands is thrown off.

To fix the error, modify your proof to first split the conjunction. For example, you might try:

  theorem cubeElements_spec_satisfied (a : Array Int) :  
    cubeElements_spec a (cubeElements a) := by  
    unfold cubeElements cubeElements_spec  
    split  
    · simp [Array.size_map]  
    · intro i h  
      simp [Array.getElem_map]  
      rfl

This directs Lean to handle the size equality and the elementwise property separately, and the “intro i h” with “rfl” then properly closes the remaining goal.

─────────────────────────────  
By following this approach, your proof will correctly address all parts of the specification, and the errors should be resolved.
