Below is our detailed reasoning followed by a plan of attack.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Understand the Function Specification

• We must write a Lean 4 function that accepts three integers (a, b, c) and returns the smallest among them.
• The output value must satisfy two properties:
  (1) It is less than or equal to a, b, and c.
  (2) It is exactly one of the three given numbers.

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Break Down the Problem

• A natural idea is to use the “min” function on integers. In Lean’s Mathlib, a function Int.min is already defined (using if-then-else) so that
  Int.min x y = if x ≤ y then x else y.
• Then the minimum of three numbers can be defined as:
  minOfThree a b c = Int.min a (Int.min b c).
 
This definition meets our needs because:
  – In the first branch, if a is less than or equal to both b and c, then Int.min a (Int.min b c) returns a.
  – Otherwise, it returns the minimum of b and c. In that branch, one must show Int.min b c equals b or equals c.

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. Consider Input Types, Edge Cases, and Expected Behavior

• Since we are working with integers (Int) which have a total order, standard comparisons hold.
• Edge cases occur when two or three inputs are equal. In such cases, our use of Int.min ensures that one of the equal values is returned.
• There is no worry about “undefined” behavior because the ordering on Int is well-founded.

──────────────────────────────
Step 4. What Proof Techniques Are Appropriate?

• Our specification predicate is:
  minOfThree_spec a b c result ↔ (result ≤ a ∧ result ≤ b ∧ result ≤ c) ∧ (result = a ∨ result = b ∨ result = c).
• We must prove that when result is defined as Int.min a (Int.min b c), it satisfies both halves.
• A good strategy is to carry out a case analysis:
  (i) First, let m = Int.min b c.
  (ii) Case 1: Assume a ≤ m. Then the definition returns a; it is trivial to show that a is ≤ a, b, c (using the properties of m).
  (iii) Case 2: Assume a > m. Then the function returns m. Now, apply a further case analysis on whether b ≤ c holds. In that subcase m = b; otherwise m = c. In either subcase, the result matches one of the inputs and satisfies the inequalities.
• For many of the linear ordering claims, we can use the linarith tactic.

──────────────────────────────
Step 5. Similar Patterns from Examples

• The examples in the documentation show the use of linarith to resolve chains of inequalities.
• They also show how to “unfold” definitions to reveal the underlying if-then-else structure (or the structure of min). That methodology fits with our case analysis in the proof.

──────────────────────────────
Detailed Plan: Implementation and Proof

1. Implementation

 • Define the function as follows:
  def minOfThree (a b c : Int) : Int :=
   Int.min a (Int.min b c)
 
 This simple definition reuses the built-in min function.

2. Specification Predicate

 • Define minOfThree_spec as given:
  def minOfThree_spec (a b c result : Int) : Prop :=
   (result ≤ a ∧ result ≤ b ∧ result ≤ c) ∧ (result = a ∨ result = b ∨ result = c)

3. Proof Outline for minOfThree_spec_satisfied

 a. Unfold both minOfThree and minOfThree_spec.
 b. Let m = Int.min b c.
 c. Perform a case analysis on whether (a ≤ m):
  • Case 1: a ≤ m
   – Then minOfThree a b c = a.
   – Show a ≤ a trivially.
   – Show a ≤ b and a ≤ c using the known property of m: since m = Int.min b c, we have m ≤ b and m ≤ c.
   – Conclude that a is one of the inputs.
  • Case 2: ¬(a ≤ m) (i.e. a > m)
   – Then minOfThree returns m.
   – By property of min, m ≤ b and m ≤ c.
   – Also, a > m implies m ≤ a.
   – Now, further do a case split on (b ≤ c):
    ◦ If b ≤ c then by the definition of Int.min, m = b.
    ◦ Otherwise, m = c.
   – In both subcases, m equals either b or c.
   – Thus, the result is one of the inputs.
 
 d. Use the linarith tactic (or direct argument) to handle inequality chains.
 e. Finally, conclude the proof by assembling both parts (inequalities and the “equal to one of” disjunction).

──────────────────────────────
Conclusion

The implementation plan is:

• Define minOfThree using Int.min.
• Prove by a two-level case analysis: first on a versus m = Int.min b c, then (if needed) on b versus c.
• Use basic properties of min and the linarith tactic to verify the required inequalities and the identity (result equals one of the inputs).

Below is a draft of our Lean 4 code (with placeholders for the proof steps):

------------------------------------------------
import Mathlib
import Aesop

-- Implementation
def minOfThree (a : Int) (b : Int) (c : Int) : Int :=
  -- We use the built-in min function.
  Int.min a (Int.min b c)

def minOfThree_spec (a : Int) (b : Int) (c : Int) (result : Int) : Prop :=
  (result ≤ a ∧ result ≤ b ∧ result ≤ c) ∧
  (result = a ∨ result = b ∨ result = c)

  unfold minOfThree minOfThree_spec
  let m := Int.min b c
  -- Case analysis on whether a ≤ m.

    rw [if_pos h₁]  -- if it were defined by if-then-else; with Int.min the proof uses its properties.
    -- Show a ≤ a, a ≤ b, a ≤ c.
    have h₂ : a ≤ b := by
      have : m ≤ b := sorry  -- use the property: Int.min b c ≤ b

    have h₃ : a ≤ c := by
      have : m ≤ c := sorry  -- similarly, use: Int.min b c ≤ c
      linarith
    exact ⟨⟨by linarith, by linarith, by linarith⟩, Or.inl rfl⟩
  · -- Case 2: a > m. Then minOfThree = m.
    rw [if_neg h₁]
    -- Now, do case analysis on b ≤ c.
    by_cases h₄ : b ≤ c
    · -- If b ≤ c then m = b.
      have eq_m : m = b := sorry  -- by property of Int.min when b ≤ c.
      rw [eq_m]
      -- Now show b ≤ a, b ≤ b, b ≤ c.
      have h : m ≤ a := by linarith [h₁]
      have h_b : b ≤ a := by rwa [←eq_m] at h
      exact ⟨⟨by linarith, by simp, by linarith⟩, Or.inr (Or.inl rfl)⟩
    · -- Otherwise, m = c.
      have eq_m : m = c := sorry  -- by property of Int.min when ¬ (b ≤ c).
      rw [eq_m]
      -- Show c ≤ a, c ≤ b, c ≤ c.
      have h : m ≤ a := by linarith [h₁]
      have h_c : c ≤ a := by rwa [←eq_m] at h
      exact ⟨⟨by linarith, by linarith, by simp⟩, Or.inr (Or.inr rfl)⟩

------------------------------------------------

In the above skeleton:
 – The "rw [if_pos h₁]" and "rw [if_neg h₁]" are schematic steps if one had defined minOfThree by explicit if-then-else. With our definition via Int.min, one should appeal directly to known lemmas about Int.min.
 – The “sorry” placeholders indicate where one would invoke results such as:
  • Int.min_left (b, c) : Int.min b c ≤ b,
  • Int.min_right (b, c) : Int.min b c ≤ c, and
  • the lemmas that show that if b ≤ c then Int.min b c = b, otherwise Int.min b c = c.
 – In a final version these would be replaced by the proper lemma invocations.

Summary

Our plan is to:
1. Implement minOfThree using the composition of Int.min.
2. Prove the specification by unfolding definitions and performing a two-level case analysis:
  – First comparing a with m = Int.min b c.
  – Then (if needed) comparing b and c to show that m equals one of them.
3. Use straightforward linear reasoning (linarith) and known properties of the min function to discharge the goals.

This step-by-step plan covers both the implementation and the correctness proof of the minimum-of-three function in Lean 4.
