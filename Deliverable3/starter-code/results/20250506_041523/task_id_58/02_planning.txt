Below is our step‐by‐step process for solving the problem along with our final plan.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Understanding the Function

• The function should check if two given integers have opposite signs.
• “Opposite signs” means one integer is strictly positive and the other is strictly negative.
• Note that zero is not positive nor negative, so if either number is zero the answer must be false.
• Thus, our condition is exactly:
  (a < 0 ∧ b > 0) ∨ (a > 0 ∧ b < 0)

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Breaking Down the Problem

• We need a function (hasOppositeSign) that returns a Boolean.
  – We compare the integers using the less-than operator.
  – Use Boolean operators (&& for “and”, || for “or”) to combine the conditions.
• Define the specification (hasOppositeSign_spec) as a proposition
  – The specification states that: 
   (a < 0 ∧ b > 0) ∨ (a > 0 ∧ b < 0) ↔ result
  – Here “result” will be exactly what our function returns.
• Finally, we need to prove (hasOppositeSign_spec_satisfied) that the implementation meets the spec.

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. Considering Inputs, Edge Cases, and Expected Behavior

• Inputs are integers. Be wary of:
  – Cases where a or b is 0 (should return false).
  – Cases where both a and b are positive (false) or both negative (false).
  – Only when one is positive and the other is negative we return true.
• Our boolean expression above automatically covers these cases because 0 does not satisfy > 0 or < 0.

──────────────────────────────
Step 4. Thinking About the Proof Techniques

• The proof will be by “unfolding” the definitions.
  – Unfold both hasOppositeSign and hasOppositeSign_spec.
  – After unfolding, both sides of the ↔ will be the same expression:
   ((a < 0 ∧ b > 0) ∨ (a > 0 ∧ b < 0))
• Therefore, the statement is clearly an equivalence (i.e. Iff.rfl).
• We need to use the Lean tactic that confirms the equality of both sides.

──────────────────────────────
Step 5. Recognizing Similar Patterns

• A common pattern in Lean proofs is to “unfold” definitions to see that two sides are definitionally equal.
• Once unfolded, if both sides are literally the same, "exact Iff.rfl" sufficiently ends the proof.
• No further case analysis is needed here.

Detailed Plan for Implementation and Proof

1. Implementation:
 • Define hasOppositeSign (a b : Int) to return ((a < 0 && b > 0) || (a > 0 && b < 0)).
 • This directly corresponds to our condition.

2. Specification:
 • hasOppositeSign_spec takes a and b along with the Boolean result.
 • It is defined by the statement: 
   (a < 0 ∧ b > 0) ∨ (a > 0 ∧ b < 0) ↔ result

3. Proof:
 • In the proof theorem hasOppositeSign_spec_satisfied, unfold both hasOppositeSign and hasOppositeSign_spec.
 • After unfolding, the equivalence is between an expression and itself, so we use Iff.rfl.
 • This shows that our implementation satisfies the specification.

Final Lean 4 Code Based on the Plan

Below is the Lean 4 code that implements our function and proves the specification:

-----------------------------------------------------------
import Mathlib
import Aesop

-- Implementation
def hasOppositeSign (a : Int) (b : Int) : Bool :=
  -- << CODE START >>
  (a < 0 && b > 0) || (a > 0 && b < 0)
  -- << CODE END >>

-- Theorem: The result is true if a and b have opposite signs
def hasOppositeSign_spec (a : Int) (b : Int) (result: Bool) : Prop :=
  -- << SPEC START >>
  ((a < 0 ∧ b > 0) ∨ (a > 0 ∧ b < 0)) ↔ result
  -- << SPEC END >>

theorem hasOppositeSign_spec_satisfied (a : Int) (b : Int) :
  hasOppositeSign_spec a b (hasOppositeSign a b) := by
  -- << PROOF START >>
  unfold hasOppositeSign hasOppositeSign_spec
  exact Iff.rfl
  -- << PROOF END >>
-----------------------------------------------------------

Conclusion

By following these steps:
• We analyzed the problem and broke it into smaller parts (function, specification, proof).
• We handled the edge cases, ensuring zero is correctly processed.
• We recognized the proof can be completed by unfolding and using reflexivity (Iff.rfl).

This completes our plan and final solution.
