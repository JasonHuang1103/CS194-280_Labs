Below is the step-by-step reasoning process along with the final plan.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Understand the function requirements

• The function is called ident.
• It takes a natural number x (Nat) as input.
• It should return the same natural number x.
• The specification ident_spec simply states that the output equals x.

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Breaking the problem into subproblems

• Implementation: Code a function ident such that given x, it returns x. In other words, the function is the identity function.
• Specification: Define ident_spec as a property stating that for a given input x and result, result = x.
• Proof: Prove that ident_spec holds for the function ident. This proof reduces to showing that x = x, which is straightforward.

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. Consider input types, edge cases, and expected behavior

• Since x is a natural number, it is always non-negative.
• The identity function does not require additional handling for any edge cases; x always equals itself.
• No extra computation or conditionals are needed.

──────────────────────────────
Step 4. Consider appropriate proof techniques

• The property to prove is ident_spec x (ident x) i.e. x = x.
• In Lean, the proof of x = x is trivial by using the reflexivity tactic (rfl), which proves equalities obtained by computation.
• Alternatively, unfolding definitions shows that both get reduced to the same term and then rfl applies.

──────────────────────────────
Step 5. Note any similar patterns or examples

• The identity function is one of the simplest functions in functional programming.
• Its specification and proof are standard: the codomain is exactly the same as the domain, making the equality immediate.
• This is often seen in many basic Lean examples where reflexivity (rfl) completes the proof.

Detailed Final Plan

1. Implementation:
   • Write the Lean function ident so that it simply returns the input x.
   • Code: def ident (x : Nat) : Nat := x

2. Specification:
   • The ident_spec is already given as a proposition that the result equals x.
   • Code remains: def ident_spec (x : Nat) (result: Nat) : Prop := result = x

3. Proof:
   • The goal theorem ident_spec_satisfied should show that ident_spec x (ident x) holds.
   • Unfolding both ident and ident_spec reveals the goal: x = x.
   • This can be proven directly using the rfl tactic.
   • Code: theorem ident_spec_satisfied (x : Nat) : ident_spec x (ident x) := by
               unfold ident ident_spec
               rfl

Final Lean 4 Solution

Below is the complete Lean 4 script based on our plan:

----------------------------------------------------------
import Mathlib
import Aesop

-- Implementation
def ident (x : Nat) : Nat :=
  -- << CODE START >>
  x
  -- << CODE END >>

def ident_spec (x : Nat) (result: Nat) : Prop :=
  -- << SPEC START >>
  result = x
  -- << SPEC END >>

theorem ident_spec_satisfied (x : Nat) :
  ident_spec x (ident x) := by
  -- << PROOF START >>
  unfold ident ident_spec
  rfl
  -- << PROOF END >>
----------------------------------------------------------

This plan clearly shows how we broke down the problem and developed both the implementation and the proof using straightforward Lean techniques.
