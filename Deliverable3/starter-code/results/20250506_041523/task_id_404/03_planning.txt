Below is our detailed reasoning and plan for implementing the function and proving its correctness.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Understand the Function Specification

• The function (myMin) takes two integers a and b.
• It must return the smaller of the two numbers.
• In the event that a = b, returning either is acceptable.
• The predetermined specification (myMin_spec) states that the result must be less than or equal to both a and b and that the result is exactly equal to one of a or b.

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Break Down the Problem into Subproblems

• First, we need to write the implementation. This is a simple “if–else” check:
  – If a ≤ b then a is the minimum.
  – Otherwise, b is the minimum.
  
• Second, we must prove that this implementation satisfies the specification myMin_spec. This proof breaks into two parts:
  1. Show that the returned value (result) is less than or equal to both a and b.
  2. Show that the result is either a or b.

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. Consider the Input Types, Edge Cases, and Expected Behavior

• Since a and b are of type Int, they can be positive, negative, or equal.
• Edge case: When a = b, our “if–else” returns a (or b), which is correct because a = b.
• No extra handling is required beyond the basic if–else structure.

──────────────────────────────
Step 4. Plan the Proof Strategy

The proof will involve unfolding the definitions of myMin and myMin_spec and then performing a case analysis on the condition (a ≤ b). Two cases naturally arise:

Case 1: a ≤ b 
  – Then myMin a b evaluates to a.
  – We must show a ≤ a (which is trivial) and a ≤ b (given by the hypothesis).
  – Also, the result is equal to a, which satisfies the “result = a ∨ result = b” clause.

Case 2: ¬(a ≤ b) 
  – Then myMin a b evaluates to b.
  – We must show b ≤ a as well as b ≤ b (again the latter is trivial). Because ¬(a ≤ b) implies a > b, we have b < a.
  – And the result is equal to b, satisfying the second part of the specification.

We can use the tactic "split_ifs" in Lean, which conveniently breaks the proof into these two cases automatically. In each branch, we then split the conjunction and use assumptions or simple arithmetic facts.

──────────────────────────────
Step 5. Note Similar Patterns and Examples

• Similar examples in Lean use an if–else structure for functions returning one of two values.
• The “split_ifs” tactic is a common way to handle proofs that branch on an “if” condition.
• In each branch, we use "split" (for the conjunction) and "left" or "right" to show the disjunction.
• The theorem proof starts by “unfolding” our definitions so that the goal is exactly the underlying propositions, and then proceeds case-by-case.

Detailed Final Plan

1. Implementation:
  • Write the function myMin in Lean as:
  
    def myMin (a : Int) (b : Int) : Int :=
      if a ≤ b then a else b

2. Specification:
  • The specification prop myMin_spec remains as given:
  
    def myMin_spec (a : Int) (b : Int) (result : Int) : Prop :=
      (result ≤ a ∧ result ≤ b) ∧ (result = a ∨ result = b)

3. Proof:
  • In theorem myMin_spec_satisfied, start by “unfolding” the definitions.
  • Use the tactic "split_ifs" to handle the two cases:
     - For the branch where a ≤ b, conclude:
         ▸ a ≤ a (by reflexivity)
         ▸ a ≤ b (by the if condition)
         ▸ result = a (so use “left”).
     - For the branch where a > b, conclude:
         ▸ b ≤ b (by reflexivity)
         ▸ b ≤ a holds since a > b (use the transitivity or the properties of order accordingly)
         ▸ result = b (so use “right”).
   • If necessary, explicitly use the ordering properties that hold for Int.

Final Code Draft

Below is the final Lean 4 code (with placeholders replaced by the actual implementation) based on the plan:

-------------------------------------------------
import Mathlib
import Aesop

-- Implementation
def myMin (a : Int) (b : Int) : Int :=
  -- Use an if–else to decide the minimum.
  if a ≤ b then a else b

-- Theorem: The minValue is either a or b; The minValue is less than or equal to both a and b
def myMin_spec (a : Int) (b : Int) (result : Int) : Prop :=
  (result ≤ a ∧ result ≤ b) ∧
  (result = a ∨ result = b)

theorem myMin_spec_satisfied (a : Int) (b : Int) :
  myMin_spec a b (myMin a b) := by
  -- Unfold definitions to reveal the underlying conditions.
  unfold myMin myMin_spec
  split_ifs with h
  · -- Case 1: a ≤ b, so myMin a b = a.
    split
    · -- Needs to show a ≤ a and a ≤ b.
      split
      · exact Int.le_refl a  -- a ≤ a
      · exact h             -- a ≤ b (from the if condition hypothesis)
    · -- Show the result is either a or b; here it is a.
      left; rfl
  · -- Case 2: ¬ (a ≤ b), so myMin a b = b.
    split
    · -- Need to show b ≤ a and b ≤ b.
      split
      · -- Since ¬ (a ≤ b), we have a > b, which means b < a and thus b ≤ a.
        have : b < a := Int.lt_of_not_ge h
        exact Int.le_of_lt this
      · exact Int.le_refl b   -- b ≤ b
    · -- Show the result is either a or b; here it is b.
      right; rfl
-------------------------------------------------

Summary

The plan is to implement myMin using an if–else on the ordering of a and b. The accompanying proof unfolds the definitions and uses "split_ifs" to perform a case analysis on the condition a ≤ b. In both cases, we verify (1) the returned value is not greater than a or b, and (2) the result equals either a or b.

This completes our detailed plan for both the implementation and the proof.
