Below is our detailed reasoning and plan to solve the problem.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Understanding the Function Requirement

• The task is to implement a function that computes the surface area of a cube.  
• The input is an integer called size (the length of an edge).  
• The formula for a cube’s surface area is 6 times the square of its edge length, i.e., 6 * size * size.

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Breaking Down the Problem

• We need a function cubeSurfaceArea that:
  - Accepts an integer size.
  - Computes and returns 6 * size * size.
• We will later prove that this function satisfies a given specification cubeSurfaceArea_spec, which exactly states that the result must equal 6 * size * size.
• There is no need to handle negative values because the problem statement assumes size > 0.

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. Inputs, Edge Cases, and Expected Behavior

• Input Type: The function is given an Int.
• Edge Cases:  
  - Technically, if a negative number or zero is given, the function will compute a number, but since the note says the input is > 0, we do not need extra checks.
• Expected Behavior:  
  - For a positive size, compute and return 6 * size * size.

──────────────────────────────
Step 4. Proof Technique

• The specification cubeSurfaceArea_spec is defined as “result = 6 * size * size”.  
• In our theorem cubeSurfaceArea_spec_satisfied, after unfolding the definitions of cubeSurfaceArea and cubeSurfaceArea_spec, the goal becomes an equality between identical expressions.
• Therefore, the proof can be completed by reflexivity (“rfl”), which is sufficient since both sides are definitionally equal.

──────────────────────────────
Step 5. Recognizing Similar Patterns

• This problem follows a standard pattern of:
  - Implementing a simple arithmetic function.
  - Proving the function’s output satisfies a given equality.
• The use of "unfold" shows the connection between our function and its specification, and then using “rfl” is a common tactic in Lean proofs for such straightforward equalities.

──────────────────────────────
Final Plan for Implementation and Proof

Implementation:
1. Define function cubeSurfaceArea to calculate 6 * size * size.
   - Write the body as: 6 * size * size.

Proof:
1. State the theorem cubeSurfaceArea_spec_satisfied for any integer size.
2. Unfold the definitions (using “unfold cubeSurfaceArea cubeSurfaceArea_spec”).
3. The goal will be identical on both sides, so use “rfl” (which means “reflexivity”) to complete the proof.

──────────────────────────────
Below is the complete Lean 4 code following this plan:

--------------------------------
import Mathlib
import Aesop

-- Implementation
def cubeSurfaceArea (size : Int) : Int :=
  -- << CODE START >>
  6 * size * size
  -- << CODE END >>

-- Theorem: The surface area of the cube is calculated correctly
def cubeSurfaceArea_spec (size : Int) (result : Int) : Prop :=
  -- << SPEC START >>
  result = 6 * size * size
  -- << SPEC END >>

theorem cubeSurfaceArea_spec_satisfied (size : Int):
  cubeSurfaceArea_spec size (cubeSurfaceArea size) := by
  -- << PROOF START >>
  unfold cubeSurfaceArea cubeSurfaceArea_spec
  rfl
  -- << PROOF END >>

--------------------------------

This implementation and proof clearly satisfy the requirements of the problem.
