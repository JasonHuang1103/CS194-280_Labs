Below is our step-by-step reasoning process and the final plan for both the implementation and the proof.

─────────────────────────────  
Step 1. Understanding the function’s purpose

• The problem requires writing a function named multiply that takes two integers a and b and returns their product (a * b).  
• The specification tells us that the output of multiply should equal a * b.  
• The theorem multiply_spec_satisfied, when unfolded, must reduce to showing "a * b = a * b", which is trivially true.  

─────────────────────────────  
Step 2. Breaking down the problem into subproblems

• Subproblem 1: Implement multiply.  
  – We can simply delegate the operation to Lean's built-in * operator for integers.  
  – This results in: multiply a b := a * b.

• Subproblem 2: Writing the specification multiply_spec.  
  – This definition is given by result = a * b.

• Subproblem 3: Proving the theorem multiply_spec_satisfied.  
  – After unfolding the definitions of multiply and multiply_spec, the theorem becomes: a * b = a * b.  
  – Lean’s reflexivity (rfl) tactic immediately proves this equality.  

─────────────────────────────  
Step 3. Considering input types, edge cases, and expected behavior

• The inputs a and b are of type Int.  
• The built-in multiplication for Int is total and correctly handles all possible integers (including negatives and zero).  
• There are no additional edge cases that need special handling beyond what the Int multiplication provides.

─────────────────────────────  
Step 4. Proof techniques to use

• Since our function is defined directly as multiplication, the proof strategy is straightforward.  
• The unfolding of definitions will reveal that the goal reduces to showing a * b = a * b.  
• The reflexivity tactic (rfl) will complete the proof because the equality is directly evident.

─────────────────────────────  
Step 5. Noting similar patterns from examples

• This pattern – defining a simple function and proving its specification via unfolding and then invoking rfl – is common in Lean.  
• Similar proofs in Lean for arithmetic operations often follow the same proof structure: unfolding and applying rfl.

Final Detailed Plan for Implementation and Proof

1. Implementation:
  – Define the function multiply by using Lean’s built-in multiplication.
   def multiply (a : Int) (b : Int) : Int := a * b

2. Specification:
  – The property that must be satisfied is already given by multiply_spec:
   def multiply_spec (a : Int) (b : Int) (result : Int) : Prop := result = a * b

3. Proof:
  – In the theorem multiply_spec_satisfied, first unfold the definitions of multiply and multiply_spec.
  – After unfolding, the goal is reduced to a * b = a * b.
  – Complete the proof using the reflexivity tactic (rfl).

Below is the final Lean 4 code that follows this plan:

-----------------------------------------------------
import Mathlib
import Aesop

-- Implementation
def multiply (a : Int) (b : Int) : Int :=
  -- << CODE START >>
  a * b
  -- << CODE END >>

-- Theorem: The result should be the product of the two input integers
def multiply_spec (a : Int) (b : Int) (result : Int) : Prop :=
  -- << SPEC START >>
  result = a * b
  -- << SPEC END >>

theorem multiply_spec_satisfied (a : Int) (b : Int) :
  multiply_spec a b (multiply a b) := by
  -- << PROOF START >>
  unfold multiply multiply_spec
  rfl
  -- << PROOF END >>
-----------------------------------------------------

This plan and code meet the problem's requirements by:
1. Correctly implementing the function to multiply two integers.
2. Writing a straightforward specification.
3. Proving the specification using basic unfolding and the reflexivity tactic.
