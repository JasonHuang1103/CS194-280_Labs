Below is our step‐by‐step reasoning, followed by a detailed plan for both implementing the function and proving the specification.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Understanding the function’s purpose

• The function isDivisibleBy11 takes an integer n and returns a Boolean.  
• It should return true exactly when n is divisible by 11, i.e. when the remainder when dividing n by 11 is 0.

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Breaking the problem into subproblems

(a) Implementation:  
 – We need to compute (n % 11) and then check whether it equals 0.  
 – Lean provides a built‐in modulo operator (%) for Int.  
 – For the Boolean check, we use the equality operator “==” on integers.

(b) Specification:  
 – The property is defined by isDivisibleBy11_spec which states that  
   n % 11 = 0 ↔ (result from isDivisibleBy11).  
 – Our implementation should satisfy that the returned Boolean true is equivalent to “n % 11 = 0.”

(c) Proof:  
 – After unfolding the definitions, our goal becomes:  
   n % 11 = 0 ↔ (n % 11 == 0)  
 – In Lean, there is generally a lemma that relates the Boolean equality “a == b” with the propositional equality “a = b.”  
 – For integers, a lemma such as Int.beq_eq (or a similar decidable equality lemma) will help us prove the equivalence.
 – The proof will essentially “unfold” definitions and then apply the appropriate lemma.

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. Considering input types, edge cases, and behavior

• Input type is Int (which can be positive, negative, or zero).  
• For n = 0 the function should return true (0 is divisible by every non-zero integer).  
• Lean’s definition of % works for negative numbers too, so the check holds in all cases.

──────────────────────────────
Step 4. Choosing proof techniques

• Our proof will be by simplification.  
• We begin by unfolding the definitions of isDivisibleBy11 and isDivisibleBy11_spec.  
• We then apply a lemma (for instance, Int.beq_eq) that states for all a, b : Int,  
  a = b ↔ a == b.  
• This directly yields the equivalence needed.

──────────────────────────────
Step 5. Noting similar patterns

• Checking divisibility by a number frequently uses the pattern: (n % divisor) == 0.  
• The specification being an “if and only if” makes the proof straightforward after unfolding.  
• Similar proofs in Lean often “unfold” the definition and then use a lemma relating Boolean equality to propositional equality.

──────────────────────────────
Plan Summary

1. Implementation  
 • Define isDivisibleBy11 to compute: (n % 11 == 0).

2. Specification  
 • State that isDivisibleBy11_spec n result is the proposition “n % 11 = 0 ↔ result.”

3. Proof  
 • In theorem isDivisibleBy11_spec_satisfied, start by unfolding the definitions; the goal becomes:  
   n % 11 = 0 ↔ (n % 11 == 0).  
 • Apply (or rewrite using) a lemma that relates Boolean equality with propositional equality for Int (e.g., Int.beq_eq).

Below is the complete Lean 4 code emerging from this plan.

-------------------------------------------------
import Mathlib
import Aesop

-- Implementation
def isDivisibleBy11 (n : Int) : Bool :=
  -- We check if the remainder when dividing n by 11 equals 0.
  n % 11 == 0

-- Specification: the result is true if and only if n is divisible by 11.
def isDivisibleBy11_spec (n : Int) (result : Bool) : Prop :=
  n % 11 = 0 ↔ result

-- Theorem: Our implementation meets the specification.
theorem isDivisibleBy11_spec_satisfied (n : Int) :
  isDivisibleBy11_spec n (isDivisibleBy11 n) := by
  -- Unfold definitions (our goal becomes: n % 11 = 0 ↔ (n % 11 == 0))
  unfold isDivisibleBy11 isDivisibleBy11_spec
  -- Apply the lemma that links propositional equality to Boolean equality.
  -- The following lemma, often available in Lean’s standard library for decidable equality,
  -- states that for integers, a = b ↔ a == b.
  apply Int.beq_eq

-------------------------------------------------

In this proof, after unfolding we use the lemma Int.beq_eq to establish the desired equivalence.

This detailed plan covers both the implementation of isDivisibleBy11 and the proof that it satisfies its specification.
