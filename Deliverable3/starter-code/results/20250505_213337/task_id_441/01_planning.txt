Below is a detailed breakdown of how to approach the task:

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Understand the Function Specification

• The function cubeSurfaceArea takes an integer (size) as an input.  
• It should return the surface area of a cube computed using the formula:
  Surface Area = 6 × (edge length)²  
• In Lean, the function must compute 6 * size * size.

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Break Down the Problem

a) Implementation:  
 • Write the function cubeSurfaceArea that multiplies six by the square of the size.  
 • The straightforward calculation is: 6 * size * size.

b) The Specification:  
 • There is a provided predicate cubeSurfaceArea_spec which states that for any given size and result, the equality result = 6 * size * size holds.  
 • We need to show that our function satisfies this specification.

c) The Proof:  
 • We need to prove that cubeSurfaceArea_spec size (cubeSurfaceArea size) holds by unfolding both the function definition and the predicate that defines the specification.  
 • Since our function is defined as 6 * size * size, after unfolding, the left-hand side becomes exactly that, and the proof should reduce to a simple reflexivity (rfl) reasoning.

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. Consider the Input Types and Edge Cases

• The edge length is given as an Int, and we assume it is greater than 0 (as per the problem statement).  
• Although a negative value would normally be an issue for a cube’s surface area, the specification is given and we assume the input satisfies the condition.  
• No extra runtime checks are necessary based on the problem description.

──────────────────────────────
Step 4. Proof Techniques

• We will use the tactic "unfold" to expand our definition of cubeSurfaceArea and cubeSurfaceArea_spec.
• Then we will apply rfl (reflexivity) since the expanded form on both sides is identically the same computation.
• This is a common pattern when proving that a concrete function satisfies a basic arithmetic specification.

──────────────────────────────
Step 5. Similar Patterns and Examples

• This style, where a trivial arithmetic relation is proved by unfolding and then using "rfl", is seen often in Lean examples with simple functions.
• The pattern is:
  - Unfold the definitions to express both sides in the same form.
  - Conclude with rfl because the two expressions are definitionally equal.

──────────────────────────────
Detailed Plan (Implementation and Proof)

A) Implementation:
 1. Define the function cubeSurfaceArea such that it returns 6 * size * size.

B) Specification:
 1. The predicate cubeSurfaceArea_spec is already provided; it specifies that result = 6 * size * size.

C) Proof:
 1. In theorem cubeSurfaceArea_spec_satisfied, start by unfolding both cubeSurfaceArea and cubeSurfaceArea_spec.
 2. After unfolding, the goal will be to show:
   6 * size * size = 6 * size * size
 3. This is true by reflexivity, so simply using “rfl” concludes the proof.

Final Lean 4 Code Sketch

Below is the complete Lean 4 code based on our plan:

------------------------------------------------
import Mathlib
import Aesop

-- Implementation: Calculate the cube's surface area
def cubeSurfaceArea (size : Int) : Int :=
  -- << CODE START >>
  6 * size * size
  -- << CODE END >>

-- Theorem: The surface area of the cube is calculated correctly
def cubeSurfaceArea_spec (size : Int) (result : Int) : Prop :=
  -- << SPEC START >>
  result = 6 * size * size
  -- << SPEC END >>

theorem cubeSurfaceArea_spec_satisfied (size : Int):
  cubeSurfaceArea_spec size (cubeSurfaceArea size) := by
  -- << PROOF START >>
  unfold cubeSurfaceArea cubeSurfaceArea_spec
  rfl
  -- << PROOF END >>
------------------------------------------------

──────────────────────────────
Conclusion

• The function cubeSurfaceArea is implemented to compute the surface area of a cube using a simple multiplication formula.  
• The accompanying theorem cubeSurfaceArea_spec_satisfied confirms that this implementation meets the specification using a direct definition unfolding and reflexivity.  

This completes the implementation and the proof.
