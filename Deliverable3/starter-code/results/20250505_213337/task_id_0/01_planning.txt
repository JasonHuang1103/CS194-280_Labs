Below is a step-by-step analysis of the problem along with a detailed plan for both the implementation and the proof.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Understand What the Function Should Do

• The task requires the implementation of a function that takes a natural number x and returns the same natural number.  
• In other words, the function is the identity (or "ident") function on the type Nat.

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Break Down the Problem into Smaller Subproblems

• Implementation:  
  – Define the function using the Lean definition syntax.  
  – The function should simply return its input, i.e., ident x = x.

• Specification:  
  – A proposition ident_spec that states for a given input x and a resulting value, result must equal x.  
  – This is just a formal way to specify that the returned result equals the input.

• Theorem/Proof:  
  – Prove that the ident function satisfies the specification.  
  – This amounts to showing that, for any x, ident x equals x (or equivalently rfl in Lean, since both sides are definitionally equal).

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. Consider the Input Types, Edge Cases, and Expected Behavior

• Input Type: The function takes a natural number (Nat) as input.  
• Edge Cases:  
  – The simplest edge case is 0.  
  – However, since our function is trivial, all the cases reduce to the same behavior (return the same number).  
• Expected Behavior:  
  – ident 0 = 0, ident 5 = 5, etc.  
  – With the identity function, there is no modification.

──────────────────────────────
Step 4. Think About Appropriate Proof Techniques

• Since the function is just returning its input, the equality ident x = x is true by definition.  
• We can use tactics such as “unfold” (to expand definitions) and then conclude with “rfl” (reflexivity) which states that both sides are definitionally equal.

──────────────────────────────
Step 5. Note Similar Patterns or Examples

• Similar patterns in Lean include simple identity functions and their proofs, where one simply proves that the output is exactly the input by applying reflexivity.
• Pattern:  
   def ident (x : Nat) : Nat := x  
   theorem ident_spec_satisfied (x : Nat) : ident x = x := rfl

Detailed Plan for Implementation and Proof

1. Implementation:  
   – In the function definition for ident, simply return x.
     Code:
     
         def ident (x : Nat) : Nat :=
           x

2. Specification Condition:  
   – Define ident_spec as a predicate asserting that the result equals the input x.
     Code:
     
         def ident_spec (x : Nat) (result : Nat) : Prop :=
           result = x

3. Proof:  
   – To prove ident_spec_satisfied (i.e., that ident_spec x (ident x) holds) for any x:
     a. Unfold the definitions of ident and ident_spec.
     b. Use rfl to conclude the proof, since both sides of the equality are definitionally the same.
     Code:
     
         theorem ident_spec_satisfied (x : Nat) :
           ident_spec x (ident x) := by
           unfold ident ident_spec
           rfl

──────────────────────────────
Final Combined Code (Lean 4):

import Mathlib
import Aesop

-- Implementation
def ident (x : Nat) : Nat :=
  -- << CODE START >>
  x
  -- << CODE END >>

def ident_spec (x : Nat) (result: Nat) : Prop :=
  -- << SPEC START >>
  result = x
  -- << SPEC END >>

theorem ident_spec_satisfied (x : Nat) :
  ident_spec x (ident x) := by
  -- << PROOF START >>
  unfold ident ident_spec
  rfl
  -- << PROOF END >>

──────────────────────────────
Summary

• We defined the function ident to simply return its input x.  
• The specification ident_spec captures that the output is equal to the input.  
• The proof unfolds both definitions and uses reflexivity (rfl) to complete the proof.

This step-by-step reasoning ensures that the implementation meets the given task description and that the proof that ident_spec holds for ident is complete and correct.
