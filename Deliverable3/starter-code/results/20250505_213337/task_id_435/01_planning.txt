Below is an explanation of the reasoning process, followed by a detailed plan for both implementing the function and proving that it meets the specification.

Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. Understanding the function:
 • The function “lastDigit” should take a non‑negative integer n (a Nat) and return its last digit.
 • To extract the last digit we use the modulo operation (n % 10) which, by construction, gives a result between 0 and 9.  
 • Thus, lastDigit n is defined as n % 10.

2. Breaking down the problem:
 • Implementation: Define lastDigit (n : Nat) to be the result of the remainder when n is divided by 10.
 • Specification: Prove that the returned result is between 0 and 9 and that it equals n % 10.
 • The spec is given as:
   (0 ≤ result ∧ result < 10) ∧ (n % 10 = result)
 • With our implementation, the second part (n % 10 = result) is trivial because result itself will be defined as n % 10.
 • The first part follows from basic properties of modulo arithmetic.

3. Considering input types, edge cases, and expected behavior:
 • The input is of type Nat (non-negative integers), so we do not have to worry about negatives.
 • An edge case is n = 0. In this case, 0 % 10 = 0, which satisfies the spec.
 • For any n, the modulo operation naturally gives a remainder in the expected range when the divisor (10) is positive.

4. Proof techniques:
 • We will use definition unfolding to expose the definition of lastDigit and lastDigit_spec.
 • For the fact that n % 10 < 10, one can either appeal to the theorem nat.mod_lt (which states that for any n and a positive m, n % m < m) or argue directly from the definition of modulo.
 • The equality n % 10 = n % 10 is immediate by reflexivity.
 • The proof will use basic tactics such as unfold, split, and applying the known lemma.

5. Similar patterns and patterns from examples:
 • Similar modulo properties are often proven using the library lemma nat.mod_lt.
 • Our theorem is a simple “by definition” proof combined with the property of mod, making it straightforward.

Detailed Plan for Implementation and Proof

Implementation Plan:
 • Define lastDigit (n : Nat) to be n % 10.
 • This is a direct implementation since Lean's % operator computes the remainder, and by definition:
   ∀ n, (n % 10) is between 0 (inclusive) and 10 (exclusive).

Proof Plan:
 • Unfold the definitions of lastDigit and lastDigit_spec.
 • Split the conjunction into two parts.
  – For the first part, prove that (0 ≤ n % 10) ∧ (n % 10 < 10):
   * 0 ≤ n % 10 follows from the fact that a remainder of a division of non-negative numbers is non-negative.
   * n % 10 < 10 is proven by applying the lemma nat.mod_lt n (dec_trivial)
  – For the second part (n % 10 = n % 10), conclude by reflexivity.
 • Combine these results to complete the theorem proof.

Final Lean Template with Comments (Plan Outline)

Below is the final plan in Lean code:

----------------------------------------------------------
import Mathlib
import Aesop

-- Implementation
def lastDigit (n : Nat) : Nat :=
  -- The last digit is obtained by computing n % 10.
  n % 10

-- Theorem: The returned digit d should be between 0 and 9; 
-- d should be the last digit of the input number n
def lastDigit_spec (n : Nat) (result : Nat) : Prop :=
  (0 ≤ result ∧ result < 10) ∧ (n % 10 = result)

theorem lastDigit_spec_satisfied (n : Nat) :
  lastDigit_spec n (lastDigit n) := by
  -- Unfold definitions of lastDigit and lastDigit_spec
  unfold lastDigit lastDigit_spec
  -- Split the conjunction into two parts.
  constructor
  { -- Show that 0 ≤ n % 10 ∧ n % 10 < 10
    constructor
    { -- Prove 0 ≤ n % 10
      exact Nat.zero_le (n % 10) },
    { -- Prove n % 10 < 10 using the library lemma; note that 10 > 0
      exact Nat.mod_lt n (by decide) } },
  { -- Prove that n % 10 equals itself (reflexivity)
    rfl }
