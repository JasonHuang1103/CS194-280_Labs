Below is a step‐by‐step explanation of what went wrong with the proof, along with some ideas on how to fix it.

──────────────────────────── Step 1: Which tactic is failing and why

After unfolding definitions and using simp, the proof splits into two parts (via the outer "constructor"). In the first part, after a further "constructor" the goal is to prove

  (1) 0 ≤ n % 10  and  (2) n % 10 < 10.

The “0 ≤ n % 10” part is handled with “apply Nat.zero_le” and is fine. The failure occurs in the proof of (2). There the script contains

  · apply Nat.mod_lt
   exact Nat.zero_lt_succ 9

The lemma Nat.mod_lt states roughly that for any natural numbers n and m, if 0 < m then n % m < m. When you “apply Nat.mod_lt” the expected proof of 0 < m is not being attached and discharged correctly. In our case m is 10, so one needs a proof of 0 < 10. (And indeed “Nat.zero_lt_succ 9” is a proof of 0 < Nat.succ 9, and since 10 is definitionally Nat.succ 9, it fits.)

However, Lean complains that the goal “n % 10 < 10” is still unsolved. Thus the subgoal for 0 < 10 was not correctly filled by the “exact Nat.zero_lt_succ 9” tactic.

──────────────────────────── Step 2: What is the proof state at that point

After the “constructor” splits the conjunction, the problematic goal is

  n : ℕ
  ⊢ n % 10 < 10

At this point, applying “Nat.mod_lt” would create a subgoal for proving 0 < 10. The tactic “apply Nat.mod_lt” generates a new subgoal:

  ⊢ 0 < 10

Then you have “exact Nat.zero_lt_succ 9” that should close that subgoal. However, due to the way bullets and indentation are arranged, Lean does not “attach” the “exact Nat.zero_lt_succ 9” as the solution to that subgoal. In fact, Lean ends up with the original goal unsolved.

──────────────────────────── Step 3: Does the proof approach match the specification?

Yes, the overall idea is sound. The specification requires that lastDigit n be between 0 and 9 and equal to n % 10. The plan is to:
1. Unfold the definitions,
2. Split the conjunction,
3. Show 0 ≤ n % 10 (via Nat.zero_le),
4. Prove n % 10 < 10 (via Nat.mod_lt, given that 0 < 10), and
5. Conclude the second conjunct with rfl.

The structure is all right; the “mathematics” is correct.

──────────────────────────── Step 4: Type mismatches or incorrect assumptions

There is no genuine type mismatch or incorrect mathematical assumption here. The only “problem” is that after “apply Nat.mod_lt” the proof of the numeric inequality 0 < 10 is not being provided correctly. The lemma Nat.mod_lt indeed expects a hypothesis of type 0 < 10. (Recall: Nat.mod_lt : ∀ {n m : ℕ}, 0 < m → n % m < m.) The tactic “exact Nat.zero_lt_succ 9” is the correct ingredient, but it must be attached as the solution to that subgoal.

──────────────────────────── Step 5: Alternative proof strategies

There are a couple of ways to fix the issue:

1. Use a one‐line proof that supplies all the arguments to Nat.mod_lt:
  exact Nat.mod_lt n 10 (Nat.zero_lt_succ 9)
This eliminates the bullet structure for that case entirely.

2. Adjust the bullet/indentation layout so that the “exact” line is properly nested under “apply Nat.mod_lt”. For example, you must ensure that the “exact” appears at a deeper indentation level than “apply Nat.mod_lt” so that Lean recognizes it as discharging the subgoal that “apply” created.

──────────────────────────── Conclusion and Direction for Fixing

The root cause is not a problem with the mathematical content, but with the proof script’s bullet/indentation structure. When you “apply Nat.mod_lt”, Lean expects you to provide a proof of 0 < 10 as a subgoal. However, because of the incorrect indentation (or bullet usage), the “exact Nat.zero_lt_succ 9” is not recognized as filling that subgoal. As a result, Lean reports that the goal n % 10 < 10 remains unsolved.

As a remedy you might:
• either rewrite the portion as
  · exact Nat.mod_lt n 10 (Nat.zero_lt_succ 9)
or
• correct the indentation so that the “exact” line is properly attached to the “apply” tactic.

Either approach will make Lean see that the proof of 0 < 10 has been provided, thereby closing the subgoal.

By fixing the bullet/indentation structure, your theorem should typecheck without error.
