Below is a detailed walk-through of our reasoning, along with a final plan for both the implementation and the accompanying proof.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Understand the Function Specification

• The task is to write a function, multiply, that takes two Int values (a and b) and returns their product.  
• The specification states that multiply a b should equal a * b.

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Break Down the Problem

The problem can be divided into two parts:
1. Implementation:  
   - We need to write the function multiply such that it correctly computes a * b.
   - Lean 4 has an existing multiplication operator (*) for integers, so the function can simply return a * b.
2. Proof:  
   - The theorem multiply_spec_satisfied must show that the implementation meets the specification.
   - After unfolding the definitions of multiply and multiply_spec, the goal reduces to proving a * b = a * b, which holds by reflexivity.

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. Consider Input Types, Edge Cases, and Expected Behavior

• Input Types:  
   - Both inputs are of type Int.
• Edge Cases:  
   - Multiplying with 0 (0 * any number = 0).
   - Multiplication with negative numbers.
   - Since we are using the built-in multiplication operator, these are already properly handled.
• Expected Behavior:  
   - For any integers a and b, multiply a b should yield the same result as a * b.

──────────────────────────────
Step 4. Proof Techniques

• The proof strategy will involve:
  - Unfolding the definitions of multiply and multiply_spec to see that the goal is a * b = a * b.
  - Applying the reflexivity tactic (rfl) to conclude the proof.
• This is a simple arithmetic identity, and Lean’s built-in tactics will suffice.

──────────────────────────────
Step 5. Similar Patterns and Examples

• Similar patterns are often seen in proofs where functions are defined in a straightforward manner and then the proof follows directly from unfolding their definitions.
• Since our multiply function is essentially defined as a multiplication operation, proving its specification is a matter of unfolding and applying rfl.

──────────────────────────────
Final Detailed Plan

1. Implementation:
   - Define the function multiply such that it returns a * b.
2. Proof:
   - Unfold the definitions of multiply and multiply_spec.
   - Apply the reflexivity tactic (rfl) to prove that multiply a b equals a * b.

──────────────────────────────
Below is the final Lean 4 code according to our plan:

-------------------------------------------------
import Mathlib
import Aesop

-- Implementation
def multiply (a : Int) (b : Int) : Int :=
  -- << CODE START >>
  a * b
  -- << CODE END >>

-- Theorem: The result should be the product of the two input integers
def multiply_spec (a : Int) (b : Int) (result : Int) : Prop :=
  -- << SPEC START >>
  result = a * b
  -- << SPEC END >>

theorem multiply_spec_satisfied (a : Int) (b : Int) :
  multiply_spec a b (multiply a b) := by
  -- << PROOF START >>
  unfold multiply multiply_spec
  rfl
  -- << PROOF END >>
-------------------------------------------------

This implementation directly returns the product using the built-in multiplication operator, while the proof unfolds the definitions and uses reflexivity to conclude the equality.

The detailed plan addresses understanding the problem, breaking it into manageable parts, considering the inputs and edge cases, deciding on a simple proof strategy, and recognizing that the solution is straightforward given the provided operations in Lean.
