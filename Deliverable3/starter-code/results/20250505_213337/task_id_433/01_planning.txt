Below is one way to work through the problem, including our reasoning and then a detailed plan for the Lean 4 implementation and proof.

──────────────────────────────
1. Understand the Function’s Role

• Our function, isGreater, receives an integer n and an array a of integers.
• It must return true exactly when n is strictly greater than every element of a.
• In formula: isGreater n a returns true iff (∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!).

──────────────────────────────
2. Break the Problem into Subproblems

a. Implementation:
   – We need to “check” the predicate (n > x) for each element x in a.
   – One way is to “fold” the array (or use a helper like “all”) while combining the Boolean answers.
   – If any element fails (i.e. n is not greater than that element) then the overall answer is false.
   – Also note that the array might be empty; by convention, the universal statement is true in that case.

b. Specification (Proof):
   – We must prove a correspondence between the computed Boolean result and the logical statement “∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!”.
   – A natural proof is by induction on the structure (or contents) of the array.
   – In the base case (empty array) the universal condition holds and the computed result is indeed true.
   – In the inductive step, assume a satisfies the equivalence and show that appending a new element preserves it.

3. Consider the Input Types, Edge Cases, and Expected Behavior

• The integer n has no restrictions.
• The array is assumed to be non-null.
• Edge-case: When a is empty, the universal quantification “∀ i, i < a.size → …” holds since there is no i such that i < 0. Hence, isGreater should return true.
• If any element of a is greater than or equal to n then we return false.

──────────────────────────────
4. Proof Techniques

• We may use structural induction over the array.
• Lean’s Array type can sometimes be connected with List via a.toList. One approach is to implement the function using a fold (or using toList.all) and then relate the result to the corresponding ∀ statement.
• In the proof, we “unfold” definitions and then use case-splitting on the empty/non-empty structure of the array.
• One may also rely on lemmas that connect list.all predicates with the corresponding universal quantification over list membership.

──────────────────────────────
5. Similar Patterns

• “all” functions on lists/arrays: In Lean, the list method “List.all” checks if a predicate holds for every element. One may employ a similar strategy.
• Folding a Boolean over a container is a standard pattern.
• The equivalence between “∀ x in a container, P x” and “the fold (with &&) over the predicate P is true” is a common argument in functional programming proofs.

Detailed Plan for Implementation and Proof

A. Implementation Plan

Plan Option 1. (Using fold over Array)
   • Use Array.fold which takes an initial Boolean value (true) and a combining function.
   • For each element x, update the accumulator with acc && (n > x).
   • In Lean 4 this becomes:
     
     def isGreater (n : Int) (a : Array Int) : Bool :=
       a.fold true (λ acc x => acc && (n > x))

Plan Option 2. (Using conversion to List)
   • Convert the array to a list using a.toList.
   • Use List.all with the predicate (λ x, n > x).
   • For example:
     
     def isGreater (n : Int) (a : Array Int) : Bool :=
       (a.toList.all (λ x => n > x))

Both options are equivalent. We will choose Option 1 (fold) as it directly works with Array.

B. Proof Plan

We need to prove:
  
  ∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!  ↔  isGreater n a

Steps:
1. Unfold the definitions. That is, replace isGreater with its fold definition and isGreater_spec with its stated formula.
2. Proceed by induction on the array a:
   - Base Case: When a is empty.
       • The universal claim “∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!” holds vacuously.
       • The fold returns true.
       • Thus, both sides are equivalent.
   - Inductive Step: Suppose the array is built by “pushing” an element to a smaller array.
       • Show that if for the reduced array the equivalence holds, then after adding a new element x the fold returns (old_result && (n > x)) and the universal statement becomes “(∀ i in old array, n > element) ∧ n > x”.
       • Note that Boolean conjunction (&&) corresponds to logical ∧ for Boolean values.
3. Conclude the equivalence holds by applying the induction hypothesis and using the obvious correspondence between (a && b = true) and the statements a = true and b = true.

C. Lean 4 Code Skeleton

Below is a sketch of the solution (with placeholders for the inductive reasoning):

------------------------------------------------------------
import Mathlib
import Aesop

-- Implementation using fold (Option 1)
def isGreater (n : Int) (a : Array Int) : Bool :=
  a.fold true (λ acc x => acc && (n > x))

-- Theorem: If the result is true then n is > every element;
-- if the result is false then there is an element that is not less than n.
def isGreater_spec (n : Int) (a : Array Int) (result : Bool) : Prop :=
  (∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!) ↔ result

theorem isGreater_spec_satisfied (n : Int) (a : Array Int) :
  isGreater_spec n a (isGreater n a) := by
  unfold isGreater isGreater_spec
  -- Proceed by induction on the structure of a.
  -- We use array induction (or convert a to a list and then use list induction).
  -- For the empty array:
  cases a with
  | nil =>
      simp  -- shows both sides evaluate to true
  | cons front tail =>
      -- Here, a = front :: tail. One can then argue as follows:
      -- 1. isGreater n a = (isGreater n front) && (n > tail.head) (if tail is nonempty)
      -- 2. The logical relation unfolds to 
      --    (∀ i, i < front.size → n > front[i]!) ∧ (n > last element)
      -- 3. Use the induction hypothesis on front.
      -- (Details omitted: in a full formal development, one would show
      --  that fold and the universal correspondence commute appropriately.)
      admit  -- (Fill in the inductive proof details)
------------------------------------------------------------

In a complete solution you would replace the "admit" with a refined induction over the array. One common approach is to first transfer the problem to lists by using a.toList and then apply list induction where the equivalence
   List.all (λ x => n > x) ↔ (∀ x ∈ a.toList, n > x)
is well known.

Conclusion

We first analyzed the problem requirements, broke the task into implementing a fold-based check and then proving by induction that the fold exactly corresponds to the universal condition. The plan includes:

1. Implementing isGreater by folding over the array with Boolean conjunction.
2. Proving the specification by unfolding both sides and performing a case analysis (empty vs. non-empty) which naturally leads to an inductive proof.

This detailed plan provides a clear guide to writing both the Lean implementation and the corresponding correctness proof.
