Below is a detailed walkthrough of the reasoning process and our final plan.

──────────────────────────────
Step-by-Step Reasoning:
──────────────────────────────
1. Understand the Function Specification:
 • The function isDivisibleBy11 takes an integer n and returns a Boolean.
 • It returns true if n is divisible by 11 and false otherwise.
 • “Divisible by 11” means that the remainder when n is divided by 11 is 0 (i.e., n % 11 = 0).

2. Break Down the Problem:
 • The core subproblem is to check whether n % 11 equals 0.
 • Since Lean’s integer operations already provide the modulo operator, we use it directly.
 • The function thus can be defined as: isDivisibleBy11 n := n % 11 = 0

3. Input Types, Edge Cases, and Expected Behavior:
 • The input type is Int. Since n can be negative or positive, we need to ensure that the modulo operation works as expected.
 • In Lean, the modulo operation (%) on Int is well-defined (it yields a remainder consistent with the chosen definition for division in Lean).
 • Edge cases include n = 0, n = 11, and negative multiples of 11—all of which are covered by the same test: n % 11 = 0.

4. Proof Techniques:
 • The specification given in the theorem is: isDivisibleBy11_spec n result ≡ (n % 11 = 0 ↔ result).
 • The proof simply unfolds the definitions of isDivisibleBy11 and the specification. Once the definition is revealed, the goal becomes (n % 11 = 0 ↔ (n % 11 = 0)), which is trivially true by reflexivity.
 • The appropriate technique here is just unfolding the definitions and using the basic property of equivalence (↔) between the same term.

5. Similar Patterns and Examples:
 • A common pattern in Lean is to define a Boolean function using a direct comparison.
 • The corresponding proofs often use unfold and simp or refl to notice that both sides of the equivalence are identical.

Final Plan for Implementation and Proof:
──────────────────────────────
A. Implementation:
 • Define isDivisibleBy11 so that it returns the result of (n % 11 = 0). This is a Boolean expression in Lean (note that in Lean a Boolean equality like “=” is a proposition, so if needed, we can explicitly use decidable equality).
 • However, for our intended specification, it is enough to write “n % 11 = 0” as it correctly represents divisibility.
 
B. Proof:
 • For the theorem isDivisibleBy11_spec_satisfied, unfold the definitions of both isDivisibleBy11 and isDivisibleBy11_spec.
 • After unfolding, the goal becomes (n % 11 = 0 ↔ (n % 11 = 0)). This is true by the reflexivity of ↔, so we finish with “rfl”.

  -- << CODE END >>

-- Theorem: The result is true if n is divisible by 11

  -- << SPEC END >>

theorem isDivisibleBy11_spec_satisfied (n : Int) :
  isDivisibleBy11_spec n (isDivisibleBy11 n) := by

  unfold isDivisibleBy11 isDivisibleBy11_spec
  rfl
  -- << PROOF END >>

──────────────────────────────
Summary:
──────────────────────────────
The function isDivisibleBy11 is implemented by directly testing if the remainder when n is divided by 11 equals 0. The specification simply states that the Boolean result correlates with this condition. The corresponding proof unfolds the definitions and shows that the equivalence is reflexively true, completing the reasoning and implementation requirements.
