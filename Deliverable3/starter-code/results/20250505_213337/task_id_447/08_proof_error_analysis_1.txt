Below is a walkthrough of the error in the proof and an analysis of what’s going wrong.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Which tactic is failing and why

The proof script ends with

  intro i hi
  rfl

after doing a “simp” on the unfolded definitions. At this point Lean still has a remaining goal:

  ∀ i, i < a.size → (Array.map (fun x => x * x * x) a)[i]! = a[i]! * a[i]! * a[i]!

By “intro i hi” we introduce a generic index i and the hypothesis hi : i < a.size. Then the tactic “rfl” is supposed to close the goal by noticing that the left‐ and right‐hand sides are definitionally equal. But they aren’t; the expression on the left does not reduce exactly to the expression on the right. (Even though intuitively they “are the same” because mapping the cubing function should compute the cube for each element, Lean’s definitional equality doesn’t see it that way.) In short, the “rfl” tactic is the failing tactic because the equality is not true by mere definition‐expansion.

Step 2. The proof state at that point

After unfolding and simplifying with

  unfold cubeElements cubeElements_spec
  simp [Array.size_map, Array.getElem_map]

the goal breaks into two conjuncts. The first conjunct, showing that (cubeElements a).size = a.size, is handled by the simp lemma ‘Array.size_map’. The second conjunct is

  ∀ i, i < a.size → (Array.map (fun x => x * x * x) a)[i]! = a[i]! * a[i]! * a[i]!

When we do “intro i hi”, the new goal is to justify the equality for that fixed i. At this point the left‐side expression still “carries” the mapping, so Lean is expecting us to do a rewrite using a result (or simp lemma) that explains how Array.getElem works on an array that has been mapped. The “rfl” tactic alone is not sufficient here.

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. Does the proof approach match the specification?

Your specification requires that each element of the result array is the cube of the corresponding element of the input array. The general approach is correct: you try to reduce the goal using the simp lemmas designed for Array.size and Array.getElem after a map. However, the proof doesn’t “finish” because the remaining goal is not solved by conversion (rfl) – it needs an additional step to rewrite the left-hand side to match the right-hand side. Thus the approach must be supplemented with an explicit rewriting step.

──────────────────────────────
Step 4. Type mismatches or incorrect assumptions

There isn’t any type mismatch or mis-assumption regarding the arrays or integers. Both sides of the equality (after index extraction) have type Int. The only issue is that the definitions and simp lemmas do not make the equation between
  (Array.map (fun x => x * x * x) a)[i]!
and 
  a[i]! * a[i]! * a[i]!
reduce by computation to the same thing. In other words, the equation is not “obviously by definition” (i.e. not definitionally equal) even though it is semantically true. This is why “rfl” fails.

──────────────────────────────
Step 5. Alternative proof strategies

A few directions to try include:
 • Instead of ending with “rfl”, use a rewriting tactic (rw) with the appropriate lemma. For example, check if there is a lemma such as Array.getElem_map that you can apply or rewrite with.
 • Use “simp” again (e.g. “simp only [Array.getElem_map]”) after introducing i and hi to complete the proof.
 • Use “congrArg” or “congr?” to explicitly show the congruence of the two sides.

For example, a fix might look like:
  theorem cubeElements_spec_satisfied (a : Array Int) :
   cubeElements_spec a (cubeElements a) := by
   unfold cubeElements cubeElements_spec
   simp [Array.size_map, Array.getElem_map]
   intro i hi
   simp  -- or use “rw [Array.getElem_map]” to rewrite the mapped getElement
   rfl

That way, the rewriting will simplify the left-hand side so that “rfl” finally succeeds.

──────────────────────────────
Conclusion: Root Cause and Direction for a Fix

The root cause of the error is that the final subgoal showing that every element of the cubed array equals the cube of the corresponding element of the original array is not solved by “rfl”. Although you introduced the index with “intro i hi”, Lean cannot close the equality by reflexivity because the left-hand side (involving the mapped function) is not definitionally equal to the right-hand side. The fix is to perform an extra rewriting/simplification step (or use an appropriate lemma) so that Lean can see both sides are the same. Adjust the proof accordingly—for example, by inserting a “rw [Array.getElem_map]” or another simp step after “intro i hi”—and then “rfl” should close the goal.

This correction should resolve the unsolved goal and make the proof complete.
