Below is a detailed analysis showing the step‐by‐step reasoning behind the error and a suggestion on how to move forward.

──────────────────────────────
1. Identifying the Failing Tactic

The error message shows that the tactic “aesop” fails to close the goal. In particular, aesop gets “stuck” on subgoals like

  ⊢ b ≤ a

when working on the branch where the function returns b. That is, after unfolding the definitions, aesop must prove that b (the returned value) is less than or equal to a, b, and c. In one branch it needs to show b ≤ a, but under the current assumptions it only has an implication 
  h : a ≤ b → c < a
and a condition
  h₁ : b ≤ c.
There is no immediate “left‐or‐right” case analysis on (a ≤ b) so aesop cannot complete the proof.

2. Considering the Proof State in the Problematic Branch

After unfolding the definition of minOfThree and the specification, when Lean considers the “else if” branch (where the code returns b) it has the following information in one case:

 • It is in the branch where the first “if” fails, so the compound condition (a ≤ b ∧ a ≤ c) is false.
 • It is using the second “if” while assuming b ≤ c.
 • Unfolding the boolean “if” shows an implication “if a ≤ b then c < a” rather than a direct assumption “¬ (a ≤ b)”.
 • Thus, the context provides an implication h : a ≤ b → c < a. Alone with h₁ : b ≤ c this is not enough for aesop to prove b ≤ a. (Intuitively, one must argue by splitting into the cases “a ≤ b” versus “¬(a ≤ b)” to conclude b ≤ a. In the “¬(a ≤ b)” case, one immediately has b < a—hence b ≤ a; in the other case, h and transitivity yield b < a again.)

3. Checking Whether the Approach Fits the Specification

The intended specification (minOfThree_spec) demands that the returned value (result) is less than or equal to each of a, b, and c and that it is equal to one of them. In the first branch (when a ≤ b ∧ a ≤ c) this is clear. However, in the second branch (when the code returns b) the specification forces us to show b ≤ a. But from the semantics of the if‐else construction, what we know is that
  ¬ (a ≤ b ∧ a ≤ c)
and b ≤ c. Unfortunately, this “negation of a conjunction” is only partially “unfolded” in the proof (as an implication h) and does not supply the necessary case analysis on whether a ≤ b is false. As a result, the approach by simply unfolding definitions and calling aesop does not easily mimic the informal “by cases” reasoning required by the specification.

──────────────────────────────
4. Investigating Type Mismatches or Incorrect Assumptions

There are no type mismatches (all relations are between integers). The problem is purely logical: the use of an implication (a ≤ b → c < a) in the proof state does not allow the tactic to conclude b ≤ a unless one explicitly uses the case splitting between “a ≤ b” and “¬(a ≤ b).” In other words, the structure of the if‐then‐else (with nested boolean tests) is such that its “else” branch carries hidden information that aesop is not unpacking.

──────────────────────────────
5. Considering Alternative Proof Strategies

A more robust strategy is to “manually” unfold the definition and then explicitly perform case distinctions on the conditions. For example, instead of relying on aesop to find the necessary reasoning, you could do a proof by cases on (a ≤ b) or even on the combined condition (a ≤ b ∧ a ≤ c). This way you would obtain:

 • In the branch where (a ≤ b ∧ a ≤ c) holds, the result is a and the specification is immediate.
 • In the branch where the first if-condition fails, you can further distinguish whether a ≤ b holds or not. In the “¬ (a ≤ b)” branch, b < a (hence b ≤ a) follows directly; in the “a ≤ b” branch, you will have to use the implication h (i.e. a ≤ b → c < a) together with b ≤ c to conclude b ≤ a by transitivity.
 
Such a case analysis removes the “hidden” condition in the if‐branch context that aesop did not exploit.

──────────────────────────────
Conclusion and Root Cause Analysis

The root cause of the error is that the aesop tactic does not automatically perform the necessary case splitting on the condition “a ≤ b” present implicitly in the “else” branch. The function definition’s structure gives rise to a context in which the only available assumption is an implication (a ≤ b → c < a) instead of a concrete case split between “a ≤ b” and its negation. Therefore, when trying to show b ≤ a we are left with two subcases:

 • if a ≤ b, then h and h₁ lead to b < a (hence b ≤ a),
 • and if ¬(a ≤ b), then b ≤ a holds because b is indeed less than a.

Aesop is not automatically “unfolding” this alternate reasoning, so the overall proof fails.

──────────────────────────────
Recommended Direction for a Fix

To resolve the issue, try a proof strategy that explicitly splits into the cases corresponding to the parts of the if‐then‐else. Rather than relying solely on aesop after “unfold,” you can use tactics like “by_cases” (or “split_ifs”) to separate the two branches and then finish each branch with standard arithmetic reasoning. For example, doing something like:

  match minOfThree a b c with
  | a  => … proof that a is the minimum …
  | b  => by
    by_cases (a ≤ b)
    · ... use h to obtain c < a and then b < a ...
    · ... if ¬(a ≤ b) then b < a holds directly ...
  | c  => … similar reasoning …

This explicit case analysis will ensure that all needed inequalities (such as b ≤ a) are derivable from your assumptions.

Summary

1. The failing tactic is aesop; it fails because it does not perform the required case analysis on the condition (a ≤ b) in the branch where b is returned.
2. In that branch, the proof state only has an implication (a ≤ b → c < a) and the condition (b ≤ c), which is not enough to prove b ≤ a without further splitting.
3. The overall approach (unfolding the definitions and calling aesop) does not match the structure of the specification, which requires case analysis hidden inside the if-conditions.
4. There’s no type error, but rather an issue with missing logical case structure.
5. A proof strategy that uses explicit case splitting (via “by_cases” or “split_ifs”) would allow you to properly handle each branch of the if-then-else and prove the specification.

Using these insights, you can modify your proof to explicitly split the cases or otherwise extract the needed assumptions in each branch so that the proof goes through.
