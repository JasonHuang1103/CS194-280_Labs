Below is a detailed walkthrough of how to solve the problem, including our reasoning at each step as well as the final plan covering both the implementation and the proof.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Understand the Function Specification

• We must create a function that takes two integers, a and b, and returns the smaller of the two.
• If a and b are equal, returning either is acceptable.
• Thus, an intuitive solution is to use an if-then-else construction: if a is less than or equal to b, return a; otherwise return b.

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Break the Problem into Smaller Subproblems

1. Implementation Subproblem:
  – Write a function myMin taking a and b.
  – Use the condition (a ≤ b) to decide which one to return.

2. Proof Subproblem:
  – We need to verify that the returned value (result) meets two conditions:
   (a) result ≤ a and result ≤ b.
   (b) result equals either a or b.
  – The proof will use a case analysis on the if-then-else structure of the function (i.e., one case where a ≤ b holds and one where it does not).

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. Consider the Input Types, Edge Cases, and Expected Behavior

• Inputs are integers, so they might be positive, negative, or zero. The straightforward ordering (≤) covers all these cases.
• Edge Case: When a = b, either branch of the if statement will work since a = b and returning a (or b) is acceptable.
• The type Int in Lean has decidable order, so we can directly use if a ≤ b then ... else ...

──────────────────────────────
Step 4. Choose Proof Techniques

• A proof by cases is the natural choice since our function is defined by an if-then-else:
  – Case 1: Assume a ≤ b. Then myMin returns a.
  – Case 2: Assume ¬ (a ≤ b), which (because of the total order on integers) gives a > b. Then myMin returns b.
• In each case, we will show:
  – The chosen result is less than or equal to both a and b.
  – And the result is exactly one of the inputs (a in the first case and b in the second).

──────────────────────────────
Step 5. Recognize Similar Patterns

• This pattern is widely seen in simple minimum functions. The structure of the proof closely follows the structure of the function.
• Using “unfold” to reveal the definitions and then “split” to handle conjunctions is a standard approach.
• The use of “if” in Lean is accompanied by tactics such as “split” and “case”, which help differentiate between the two branches.

──────────────────────────────
Final Plan

1. Implementation:
  – Define myMin using an if-then-else: 
   def myMin (a : Int) (b : Int) : Int :=
     if a ≤ b then a else b

2. Proof:
  – Prove theorem myMin_spec_satisfied by unfolding myMin and myMin_spec.
  – Use a case analysis (or "by cases") on the assumption a ≤ b.
  – In the first branch (when a ≤ b), show that:
   • a ≤ a is trivial.
   • a ≤ b is our assumption.
   • And clearly a = a.
  – In the second branch (when ¬ (a ≤ b), i.e., a > b), show that:
   • b ≤ b is trivial.
   • b ≤ a follows when a > b.
   • And clearly b = b.
  – Therefore, in both cases, the specification holds.

Final Lean Code Sketch

Below is a sketch of what the Lean code might look like:

--------------------------------------------------
import Mathlib
import Aesop

-- Implementation
def myMin (a : Int) (b : Int) : Int :=
  -- << CODE START >>
  if a ≤ b then a else b
  -- << CODE END >>

-- Theorem: The minValue is either a or b; The minValue is less than or equal to both a and b
def myMin_spec (a : Int) (b : Int) (result : Int) : Prop :=
  -- << SPEC START >>
  (result ≤ a ∧ result ≤ b) ∧
  (result = a ∨ result = b)
  -- << SPEC END >>

theorem myMin_spec_satisfied (a : Int) (b : Int) :
  myMin_spec a b (myMin a b) := by
  -- << PROOF START >>
  unfold myMin myMin_spec;
  by_cases h : a ≤ b,
  { -- Case where a ≤ b, so myMin a b = a.
    simp [if_pos h],
    split,
    { split,
      { exact le_refl a, },
      { exact h, } },
    { left, refl, } },
  { -- Case where ¬ (a ≤ b), so myMin a b = b.
    simp [if_neg h],
    -- Since a and b are totally ordered, ¬ (a ≤ b) implies b < a,
    -- hence b ≤ a.
    have h' : b < a := lt_of_not_ge h,
    split,
    { split,
      { exact le_of_lt h', },
      { exact le_refl b, } },
    { right, refl, } }
  -- << PROOF END >>

--------------------------------------------------

This plan covers both the implementation and the associated proof, matching the specifications and ensuring that the result is indeed the minimum of the two integers.
