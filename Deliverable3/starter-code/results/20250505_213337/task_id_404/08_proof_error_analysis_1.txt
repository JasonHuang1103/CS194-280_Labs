Below is a step‐by‐step analysis of the issue:

1. Tactic That Fails  
 • The error message “tactic 'introN' failed, insufficient number of binders” indicates that the tactic called “intro” (which internally calls introN) is failing.  
 • This happens because the “intro” tactic is intended for goals that start with a function type or an implication (i.e. something like “∀ …, P”) where it would introduce bound variables or hypotheses. In your case, after unfolding, the goal is just a proposition (a conjunction of conditions) with no leading binder.  

2. Proof State at the Point of Failure  
 • After executing "unfold myMin myMin_spec", the goal becomes:  
  ((if a ≤ b then a else b) ≤ a ∧ (if a ≤ b then a else b) ≤ b) ∧ ((if a ≤ b then a else b) = a ∨ (if a ≤ b then a else b) = b)  
 • There are no universally bound variables or antecedents to “introduce.” Hence, when you run “intro” expecting to obtain a new hypothesis, Lean complains about “insufficient number of binders.”

3. Checking the Proof Approach Against the Specification  
 • Your specification (myMin_spec) requires two parts: a conjunction stating the result is ≤ both a and b, and a disjunction stating the result equals either a or b.  
 • The intended proof by splitting cases using “split” and “split_ifs” is a good approach once the definitions have been unfolded.  
 • However, the unnecessary “intro” (and its attempted introduction of a binder) is not required for proving a conjunction that doesn’t start with an implication.

4. Type Mismatches or Incorrect Assumptions  
 • Aside from “intro”, some parts like using “apply le_of_not_le assumption” or “apply le_of_lt assumption” might also raise issues if the types don’t match exactly. (For example, you must ensure Lean’s order relations are properly used.)  
 • But the error message here is solely about the use of “intro”. The proof technique of case splitting via “split_ifs” is largely appropriate once that error is fixed.

5. Alternative Proof Strategies  
 • Simply remove the “intro” tactic right after “unfold” since your goal does not require introducing any new assumptions.  
 • Alternatively, if you wanted to work with a lambda style proof (i.e. by explicitly naming the result after unfolding a universally quantified statement), you would first need to state your theorem in that style. In the current formulation, the removal of “intro” is the simplest fix.

Conclusion and Direction for Fixing  
 • The root cause of the error is that you used “intro” when the goal did not have any binders (i.e., no antecedent or universally quantified variable was present).  
 • To fix the error, simply remove the “intro” tactic. Your proof should then start with “unfold myMin myMin_spec” followed by “split” (and then “split_ifs” in the appropriate branches).  
 • This change will bring the proof into alignment with the structure of your goal and satisfy Lean’s expectations for tactic application.

By removing “intro”, your proof should type-check (assuming the rest of the steps align with Lean 4’s expectations for the order relation proofs).
