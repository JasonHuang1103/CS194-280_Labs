Below is an explanation of what went wrong, with step‐by‐step reasoning:

───────────────────────────── 
1. Which tactic is “failing” and why

The error “unexpected identifier; expected command” appears just as Lean sees an identifier (in this case a bullet “·” or the very next tactic line after a previous command). In our proof the very next line after

  simp [decide_eq_true_eq]

is

  rcases lt_trichotomy a 0 with (ha | rfl | ha)

or one of the indented bullet lines like

  · rcases lt_trichotomy b 0 with (hb | rfl | hb)

Lean complains because it is “surprised” to see an identifier (or a bullet) in a place where a tactic command is expected. In short, one of the “rcases” tactics (or one of the bulleted commands) is not being recognized as part of the tactic script.

───────────────────────────── 
2. Consider the proof state at that point

After we do ‘unfold’ and ‘simp’, the goal has been simplified so that the statement becomes

  ((a < 0 ∧ b > 0) ∨ (a > 0 ∧ b < 0)) ↔ ((decide (a < 0) && decide (b > 0)) || (decide (a > 0) && decide (b < 0)))

At that moment we wish to solve this statement by a case analysis on the three possibilities from lt_trichotomy on “a”. (A similar case analysis is intended for “b” later on.) So the intended plan is to have three subgoals and, in each case, do further case splits with rcases and bullet lists. However, Lean never “enters” the case‐splitting mode if the commands following ‘simp’ are not parsed as tactics.

───────────────────────────── 
3. Does the proof approach match the specification?

The specification says that the boolean result returned by hasOppositeSign is equivalent to the disjunction (a < 0 ∧ b > 0) ∨ (a > 0 ∧ b < 0). The proof tries to show the equivalence by “unfolding” the definitions and then doing a case‐analysis on the possible signs of a and b. In principle this is a reasonable approach. (There is also a design decision about working with booleans versus propositions, but that is not the core error here.)

───────────────────────────── 
4. Any type mismatches or incorrect assumptions?

One potential red flag is the use of rfl as a pattern in an rcases clause – for example

  rcases lt_trichotomy a 0 with (ha | rfl | ha)

In this case the middle branch is supposed to capture the situation a = 0. (And then in the “a = 0” branch, one further uses rcases eq_or_lt_of_le (Int.le_of_eq rfl) with rfl | hb.) Although it might look “clever”, using rfl in pattern-matching in this way can be confusing. However, the error message is not about a type mismatch; it is about the parser not “seeing” a command where one is expected. (That being said, one should eventually check that the equality pattern really makes sense in context.)

───────────────────────────── 
5. Alternative proof strategies

An alternative is not to try to do the detailed case analysis manually but rather rely on simp or case splits that automatically “unfold” the decide booleans. You might also try to split on decide (a < 0) and decide (a > 0) instead (using the fact that if a = 0 the booleans will simplify appropriately).

Another strategy is to use the “by_cases” construct if suitable or to use ‘cases’ instead of ‘rcases’ if the pattern matching becomes too “clever.”

───────────────────────────── 
Detailed Analysis of the Root Cause and What to Do Next

The diagnosis is that Lean is reporting “unexpected identifier; expected command” because it is not recognizing the command that begins with “rcases” (or, in some cases, the bullet “·”) as part of the same tactic block. This is usually caused by one of two issues:

• Mis-indentation: In Lean 4 the “by” tactic block is sensitive to whitespace and bullet indentation. All tactic commands inside the “by” block must be indented consistently so that Lean knows they are part of the proof. It appears that after “simp [decide_eq_true_eq]” the following “rcases” (and its bullets) are not indented correctly or are not in the expected scope corresponding to the subgoal that “simp” produced.

• Improper use of bullet syntax in combination with the rcases tactic: Bullets like “·” or “-” are only allowed when Lean already knows that you’re about to work on a split subgoal. If a command does not “open” a subgoal block where bullets are allowed (or if the indentation is off), Lean sees these bullets as “free-floating” identifiers; hence the error.

To fix the error you should check the indentation of all tactic commands. Every tactic after “by” must be indented one level (and bullets should be indented one extra level inside a nested block). In our code it may be that the lines after “simp [decide_eq_true_eq]” are not indented correctly or that the bullets appear at the wrong indentation level. For example, rewriting the proof as

 theorem hasOppositeSign_spec_satisfied (a b : Int) :
   hasOppositeSign_spec a b (hasOppositeSign a b) := by
   unfold hasOppositeSign hasOppositeSign_spec
   simp [decide_eq_true_eq]
   rcases lt_trichotomy a 0 with (ha | rfl | ha)
   · rcases lt_trichotomy b 0 with (hb | rfl | hb) where
       -- sub-case analysis on b here…
       ...
   · rcases eq_or_lt_of_le (Int.le_of_eq rfl) with rfl | hb where
       ...
   · rcases lt_trichotomy b 0 with (hb | rfl | hb) where
       ...
   done

ensures that Lean knows each bullet is part of the corresponding case split. (The “where” keyword is optional but sometimes helps make the structure explicit.) 

───────────────────────────── 
Conclusion

The error arises because one or more of your tactic commands (starting with “rcases” or the bullets “·”) are not recognized as valid command commands in the “by” block. This happens due to an indentation/formatting issue (and possibly an overly clever use of rfl in patterns) so that Lean’s parser is expecting a top-level command but finds an identifier or bullet where it does not belong.

To fix the problem, reformat the proof so that every tactic within the “by” block is indented correctly and any nested bullet lists are properly aligned. Once the indentation is corrected, Lean will parse the entire tactic block as intended and the error should go away. Additionally, you might want to check that using rfl as a pattern in rcases is really what you intend. 

This should put you on the right track toward a corrected proof.
