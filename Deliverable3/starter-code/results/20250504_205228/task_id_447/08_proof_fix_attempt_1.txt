The issue arises from using `unfold` incorrectly, as the goal after `unfold` does not have the target structure for `cubeElements` directly in the context due to `cubeElements` being used immediately as an argument. Additionally, you incorrectly applied `simp` on `Array.getElem`, which was incorrect in this context. The solution involves using the simplification lemma for `Array.map` correctly.

Here's the fixed version of the proof:

```lean
theorem cubeElements_spec_satisfied (a : Array Int) :
  cubeElements_spec a (cubeElements a) := by
  unfold cubeElements cubeElements_spec
  constructor
  case left =>
    exact Array.size_map _ _
  case right =>
    intro i hi
    simp [Array.getElem, Array.map]
```

This uses `simp` to handle mapping inside arrays, which correctly breaks down the array mapping inside the goal, allowing you to complete the proof effectively.
