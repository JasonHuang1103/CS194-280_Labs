Certainly! The errors you're encountering are due to redundant declarations and an incomplete proof. Let's correct the proof:

```lean
  -- PROOF START
  unfold cubeElements cubeElements_spec
  constructor
  case left =>
    -- Use size_map property of Array.map which ensures the size remains unchanged
    exact Array.size_map _ _
  case right =>
    intro i hi
    -- We apply simp to unfold map and use getElem to resolve the correct element position
    -- Given that hi is i < a.size, it follows i < a.size = map f a.size
    simp [Array.getElem, Array.map, hi]
  -- PROOF END
```

Key corrections made:
1. Removed duplicate theorem declaration.
2. The original proof already correctly utilized the `size_map` property under `case left`, which confirms the sizes are equal.
3. Simplified the application of the lambda function in mapping with `simp` for the element-wise proof in `case right`.
