Below is a detailed plan outlining the approach to solving the problem, both for the function implementation and for its accompanying correctness proof.

─────────────────────────────  
1. Overview of the Task

• We need to write a function cubeElements that, given an array a : Array Int, returns an array where every element has been replaced by its cube (i.e., multiplied by itself three times).

• Then, we must prove that the returned array meets the specification:
  - It has the same length as the input array.
  - For every valid index i, the element in the result array is exactly the cube of the corresponding element in the input array.

─────────────────────────────  
2. Implementation Strategy

The intuitive and Lean-friendly way to perform a transformation on all elements of an array is to use the array’s built-in map function. The transformation function here is “λ x, x * x * x.” Thus, the implementation step is:
  
  • Define cubeElements a := a.map (fun x => x * x * x)

This automatically ensures that the size of the array is unchanged. (Lean’s standard library for Array defines map in such a way that it does not change the size of the array.)

─────────────────────────────  
3. Proof Strategy

The goal of the theorem cubeElements_spec_satisfied is to show that for every input array a, cubeElements_spec a (cubeElements a) holds. We need to prove two things:

(a) (Size preservation) Prove that (cubeElements a).size = a.size.

  – Since cubeElements is defined as a.map f, use the fact that a.map preserves the size of the array. Lean’s library for Array usually has a lemma or property (perhaps named Array.map_size) that guarantees (a.map f).size = a.size.

(b) (Correct element transformation) Prove that for every index i, if i < a.size then (cubeElements a)[i]! = a[i]! * a[i]! * a[i]! 

  – Again, under the definition cubeElements a = a.map (fun x => x * x * x), we can invoke the property of map that relates get on the mapped array with applying the function to the corresponding element of the original array. In other words, for any i that is a valid index, (a.map f)[i]! = f (a[i]!).

─────────────────────────────  
4. Detailed Steps of the Proof

Step 1: Unfold the definitions. Begin the proof by unfolding cubeElements and cubeElements_spec.

Step 2: Prove size preservation:

  – Show that (a.map (λ x => x * x * x)).size = a.size using the lemma on Array.map size preservation.

Step 3: Prove the transformation property for each index:

  – For every i with i < a.size, apply the lemma (or property) that states (a.map f)[i]! = f (a[i]!)
  – Then, replacing f with “λ x, x * x * x,” we see that (a.map (λ x, x * x * x))[i]! = a[i]! * a[i]! * a[i]! as desired.

Step 4: Combine the two parts with a conjunction to conclude cubeElements_spec a (cubeElements a).

5. Coding the Implementation and Proof in Lean

• Implementation Code: Use Array.map to define cubeElements.
• Proof Code: Use the basic array lemmas (e.g., on map preservation of size and retrieving mapped elements) to show both parts of the spec.

Your Lean code template, with our plan, might look roughly as follows:

─────────────────────────────  
import Mathlib
import Aesop

-- Implementation
def cubeElements (a : Array Int) : Array Int :=
  -- << CODE START >>
  a.map (fun x => x * x * x)
  -- << CODE END >>

-- Specification: The result array has the same size as the input and each element is cubed.
def cubeElements_spec (a : Array Int) (result : Array Int) : Prop :=
  -- << SPEC START >>
  (result.size = a.size) ∧
  (∀ i, i < a.size → result[i]! = a[i]! * a[i]! * a[i]!)
  -- << SPEC END >>

theorem cubeElements_spec_satisfied (a : Array Int) :
  cubeElements_spec a (cubeElements a) := by
  -- << PROOF START >>
  dsimp [cubeElements, cubeElements_spec]  -- unfold the definitions
  constructor
  · -- Prove the size is preserved:
    -- Here we use the property that map preserves size.
    -- Depending on your version of Lean, you might have a lemma like Array.map_size.
    rw [Array.size_map]
  · -- Prove that for every index i, the cube transformation holds.
    intro i hi
    -- If your library has a lemma for `get_map`, it may state that (a.map f)[i]! = f (a[i]!).
    rw [Array.get_map hi]
  -- << PROOF END >>

─────────────────────────────  
6. Final Remarks

• Note that the specific names of lemmas, such as Array.size_map or Array.get_map, might differ based on your version of Mathlib. Check your available lemmas or adjust accordingly.

• The overall approach uses functional programming paradigms combined with properties of Array.map to ensure both correctness and size preservation, leading to a clear and concise implementation and proof.

This plan outlines the key steps required to both code the function and prove its correctness in Lean 4.
