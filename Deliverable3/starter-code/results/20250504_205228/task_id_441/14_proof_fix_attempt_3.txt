```lean
-- Corrected proof content

theorem cubeSurfaceArea_spec_satisfied (size : Int):
  cubeSurfaceArea_spec size (cubeSurfaceArea size) := by
  unfold cubeSurfaceArea cubeSurfaceArea_spec
  rfl
```

Here is the explanation of the fix:

1. The error at `Lean Error: lean_playground/TempTest.lean:18:54: error: unsolved goals` suggests there was some confusion in the declaration or redundancy in unfolding. The original code repeated the declaration `theorem cubeSurfaceArea_spec_satisfied...` inside the proof, which should not happen. That line has been removed from the proof.

2. The second error indicates that there is a redeclaration of `cubeSurfaceArea_spec_satisfied`. This was because the theorem declaration was erroneously repeated inside the proof block, causing a duplicate declaration error. Keeping only one declaration line outside the proof block resolves this issue.

With these corrections, the proof specifies correctly using `unfold` for definitions and concludes with `rfl` because the equations simplify to reflexivity.
