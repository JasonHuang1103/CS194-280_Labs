The error in your proof occurs because you are trying to unfold `cubeSurfaceArea` in a goal that is already simplified enough for applying `rfl`. You don't need to unfold both `cubeSurfaceArea` and `cubeSurfaceArea_spec` explicitly. Here's the corrected proof:

```lean
theorem cubeSurfaceArea_spec_satisfied (size : Int):
  cubeSurfaceArea_spec size (cubeSurfaceArea size) := by
  -- << CORRECTED PROOF START >>
  rfl
  -- << CORRECTED PROOF END >>
```

By using `rfl` directly, we can recognize that both sides of the equation are definitionally equal, thereby eliminating the errors related to unnecessary unfolding.
