Below is a plan outlining the steps to solve the problem, followed by an explanation of the approach.

1. Implementation of cubeSurfaceArea

• We need to implement a function that computes the surface area of a cube.
• The surface area formula is 6 * (edge length)^2.
• Given Lean’s arithmetic on integers and associativity of multiplication, writing 6 * size * size directly is acceptable.

──────────────────────────────
2. Specification of the Function

• We provide a specification predicate cubeSurfaceArea_spec that says the result should equal 6 * size * size.
• This is meant to be a property showing that our function meets the intended formula.

──────────────────────────────
3. Theorem to Prove Correctness (cubeSurfaceArea_spec_satisfied)

• We need to prove that for every size, cubeSurfaceArea_spec size (cubeSurfaceArea size) holds.
• This involves unfolding the definitions of cubeSurfaceArea and cubeSurfaceArea_spec.
• After the definitions are unfolded, the statement becomes “6 * size * size = 6 * size * size.”
• Since this equality is trivial, the proof can be completed by using reflexivity (rfl).

4. Detailed Steps in the Lean Code

a. Define cubeSurfaceArea so that it computes 6 * size * size.
b. Write the cubeSurfaceArea_spec predicate as given.
c. In the theorem cubeSurfaceArea_spec_satisfied, start a proof block.
d. Unfold the definitions so that the goal becomes 6 * size * size = 6 * size * size.
e. Use rfl (i.e. reflexivity) to finish the proof.

5. Putting It All Together

When you implement the code in Lean, it will follow the above structure. Thanks to the simplicity of the arithmetic involved, the key steps are:

• Function Implementation: Straightforward arithmetic.
• Specification: Direct equality to the computed expression.
• Proof: Unfolding and then using rfl.

Below is an illustration in Lean pseudocode with the placeholders replaced:

--------------------------------------------------
import Mathlib
import Aesop

-- Implementation
def cubeSurfaceArea (size : Int) : Int :=
  -- << CODE START >>
  6 * size * size
  -- << CODE END >>

-- Theorem: The surface area of the cube is calculated correctly
def cubeSurfaceArea_spec (size : Int) (result : Int) : Prop :=
  -- << SPEC START >>
  result = 6 * size * size
  -- << SPEC END >>

theorem cubeSurfaceArea_spec_satisfied (size : Int):
  cubeSurfaceArea_spec size (cubeSurfaceArea size) := by
  -- << PROOF START >>
  unfold cubeSurfaceArea cubeSurfaceArea_spec
  rfl
  -- << PROOF END >>
