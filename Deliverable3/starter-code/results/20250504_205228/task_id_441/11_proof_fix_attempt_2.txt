The error in your proof seems to be caused by having defined `cubeSurfaceArea_spec_satisfied` twice and an incorrect unfolding command. Let's correct the proof:

```lean
theorem cubeSurfaceArea_spec_satisfied (size : Int):
  cubeSurfaceArea_spec size (cubeSurfaceArea size) := by
  unfold cubeSurfaceArea cubeSurfaceArea_spec
  rfl
``` 

Here, the issue was that you repeated the declaration line for `cubeSurfaceArea_spec_satisfied` within the proof. Also, removing the duplicate definition resolves the error. Additionally, the proof is correct for the provided definition and works as expected once these issues are addressed.
