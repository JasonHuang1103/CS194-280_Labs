The error message indicates that there's a problem with the way the `unfold` tactic handles `minOfThree` in the current context. Lean is struggling to unfold the definition properly because the expression is deeply nested within the conjunctions and disjunctions. Instead, we need to unfold `minOfThree` manually by using cases or conditions to assist the unfolding process. Here's a corrected proof:

```lean
theorem minOfThree_spec_satisfied (a : Int) (b : Int) (c : Int) :
  minOfThree_spec a b c (minOfThree a b c) := by
  unfold minOfThree_spec
  unfold minOfThree
  split
  · split
    · -- Prove result <= a
      by_cases h₁ : a <= b
      · by_cases h₂ : a <= c
        · simp [h₁, h₂]
        · simp [h₁, h₂]
          exact h₂
      · by_cases h₂ : b <= c
        · simp [h₁, h₂]
        · simp [h₁, h₂]
          exact h₂
    · -- Prove result <= b
      by_cases h₁ : a <= b
      · by_cases h₂ : a <= c
        · simp [h₁, h₂]
          exact h₁
        · simp [h₁, h₂]
          have : c <= b := le_trans h₁ (le_of_not_ge h₂)
          assumption
      · by_cases h₂ : b <= c
        · simp [h₁, h₂]
        · simp [h₁, h₂]
          let : b <= c := le_of_not_ge h₂
          have : c <= b := le_of_not_ge h₁
          assumption
    · -- Prove result <= c
      by_cases h₁ : a <= b
      · by_cases h₂ : a <= c
        · simp [h₁, h₂]
          exact h₂
        · simp [h₁, h₂]
      · by_cases h₂ : b <= c
        · simp [h₁, h₂]
          exact h₂
        · simp [h₁, h₂]
  · -- Prove result is one of a, b, c
    by_cases h₁ : a <= b
    · by_cases h₂ : a <= c
      · simp [h₁, h₂]
      · simp [h₁, h₂]
    · by_cases h₂ : b <= c
      · simp [h₁, h₂]
      · simp [h₁, h₂]
```

This proof use the `by_cases` tactic to unfold the conditions properly and proves all the necessary inequalities and equalities to satisfy the specification. Note that I fixed a few issues with unnecessary complexities in proving transitive properties, simplifying the proof steps.
