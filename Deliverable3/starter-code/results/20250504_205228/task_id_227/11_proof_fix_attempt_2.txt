The proof you provided contains redundant duplication of the theorem declaration and inconsistencies in handling the hypotheses. Additionally, controlling the logical flow for proving the specification isn't correctly articulated in the proof. Here's a corrected version of the proof:

```lean
theorem minOfThree_spec_satisfied (a : Int) (b : Int) (c : Int) :
  minOfThree_spec a b c (minOfThree a b c) := by
  unfold minOfThree minOfThree_spec
  split
  · -- Prove result <= a ∧ result <= b ∧ result <= c
    split
    · -- Prove result <= a
      by_cases h₁ : a <= b
      · by_cases h₂ : a <= c
        · simp [h₁, h₂]  -- a <= both b and c, hence result = a
        · simp [h₁, h₂]  -- a <= b, but c < a, hence result = c
          exact le_of_not_ge h₂
      · by_cases h₂ : b <= c
        · simp [h₁, h₂]  -- b < a and b <= c, hence result = b
        · simp [h₁, h₂]  -- b < a, but c < b, hence result = c
          exact le_of_not_ge h₂
    · split
      · -- Prove result <= b
        by_cases h₁ : a <= b
        · by_cases h₂ : a <= c
          · simp [h₁, h₂] -- result = a, and a <= b by h₁
            exact h₁
          · simp [h₁, h₂] -- result = c, need to show c <= b
            have : c <= b := le_of_not_ge h₂
            assumption
        · by_cases h₂ : b <= c
          · simp [h₁, h₂] -- result = b
          · simp [h₁, h₂] -- result = c, need to show c <= b
            have : c <= b := le_of_not_ge h₂
            assumption
      · -- Prove result <= c
        by_cases h₁ : a <= b
        · by_cases h₂ : a <= c
          · simp [h₁, h₂] -- result = a, and a <= c by h₂
            assumption
          · simp [h₁, h₂] -- result = c
        · by_cases h₂ : b <= c
          · simp [h₁, h₂] -- result = b, need to show b <= c
            assumption
          · simp [h₁, h₂] -- result = c
  · -- Prove result = a ∨ result = b ∨ result = c
    by_cases h₁ : a <= b
    · by_cases h₂ : a <= c
      · simp [h₁, h₂] -- result = a
      · simp [h₁, h₂] -- result = c
    · by_cases h₂ : b <= c
      · simp [h₁, h₂] -- result = b
      · simp [h₁, h₂] -- result = c
```

This proof follows a structured approach of splitting and reasoning through cases by eliminating contradictions and ensuring all conditions and outcomes are handled correctly according to the `if-else` structure provided in the definition of `minOfThree`.
