To fix the errors in the proof, we need to correct the misuse of theorem declaration and simplify the proof to correctly handle the conditions based on the result of `myMin`. Here's the fixed proof content:

```lean
theorem myMin_spec_satisfied (a : Int) (b : Int) :
  myMin_spec a b (myMin a b) := by
  unfold myMin myMin_spec
  by_cases h : a ≤ b
  · -- Case where a ≤ b
    simp [h]
    constructor
    · exact ⟨le_refl a, le_trans h (le_refl b)⟩
    · left
      rfl
  · -- Case where ¬ (a ≤ b), i.e., a > b
    simp [h]
    constructor
    · exact ⟨le_of_lt (not_le.mp h), le_refl b⟩
    · right
      rfl
```

Notes on corrections:
- The duplicate theorem declaration error was caused by defining `myMin_spec_satisfied` twice. Make sure to only have one definition of the theorem.
- The condition `le_of_not_le h` was incorrect. It's now using `le_of_lt (not_le.mp h)` to correctly derive `b ≤ a` from `a > b`.
