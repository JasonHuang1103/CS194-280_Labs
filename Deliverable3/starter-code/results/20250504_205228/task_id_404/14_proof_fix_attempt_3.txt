Below is the corrected version of the proof. The original issue occurred because the theorem `myMin_spec_satisfied` was accidentally declared twice, resulting in a duplicate declaration error. I've also removed unnecessary inner declarations and made sure the proof structure follows logical reasoning based on cases.

```lean
theorem myMin_spec_satisfied (a : Int) (b : Int) :
  myMin_spec a b (myMin a b) := by
  unfold myMin myMin_spec
  by_cases h : a ≤ b
  · -- Case where a ≤ b
    simp [h]
    constructor
    · exact ⟨le_refl a, h⟩
    · left
      rfl
  · -- Case where ¬(a ≤ b), i.e., a > b
    simp [h]
    constructor
    · exact ⟨not_le.mp h, le_refl b⟩
    · right
      rfl
```

In this corrected proof:

- The duplicate theorem declaration was removed.
- The reasoning was completed correctly for both branches (when `a ≤ b` and when `a > b`). 
- When `a ≤ b`, the result is `a`, and we prove the desired properties: `result ≤ a`, `result ≤ b`, and `result = a`.
- When `a > b`, the result is `b`, and we prove: `result ≤ a`, `result ≤ b`, and `result = b` using appropriate implications.
