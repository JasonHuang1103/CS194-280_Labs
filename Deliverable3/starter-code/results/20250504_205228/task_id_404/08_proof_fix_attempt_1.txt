Certainly! It seems like there's unnecessary repetition in the `unfold` tactic and the way we handle conditionals with `if`. The use of `by_cases` with `simp` can be adjusted for a clearer proof. Here's the corrected version of your proof:

```lean
theorem myMin_spec_satisfied (a : Int) (b : Int) :
  myMin_spec a b (myMin a b) := by
  unfold myMin myMin_spec
  by_cases h : a ≤ b
  · -- Case where a ≤ b
    simp [h]
    constructor
    · exact ⟨le_refl a, le_trans h (le_refl b)⟩
    · left
      rfl
  · -- Case where ¬ (a ≤ b), i.e., a > b
    simp [h]
    constructor
    · exact ⟨le_of_not_le h, le_refl b⟩
    · right
      rfl
```

This proof uses `constructor` to establish conjunctions and handles both cases using `simp` and direct axioms like `le_refl` and `le_of_not_le`. Each branch correctly addresses the necessary implications of the `if` condition.
