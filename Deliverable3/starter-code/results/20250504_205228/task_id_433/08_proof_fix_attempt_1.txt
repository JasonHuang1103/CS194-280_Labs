The error in your proof arises from the attempt to use an incorrect tactic `apply Array.foldr_induction_on`, which does not exist in Lean. Instead, you should apply appropriate induction principles on the `Array` and use reasoning about lists, since arrays in Lean are built on top of lists. Let's rewrite the proof using induction directly on the list backing the array.

Here is the corrected proof:

```lean
theorem isGreater_spec_satisfied (n : Int) (a : Array Int) :
  isGreater_spec n a (isGreater n a) := by
  -- Unfold the definitions of `isGreater` and `isGreater_spec`.
  unfold isGreater isGreater_spec

  -- Induction on the underlying list of the array.
  induction a.length with
  | zero =>
    -- Base case: the array is empty.
    simp
    -- Both sides of the implication are trivially true.
  | succ len ih =>
    -- Inductive step: assume the statement holds for arrays of length `len`.
    rw [Array.foldl_eq_foldr_rev, List.foldr_eq_foldr, List.foldr_cons]
    split
    · -- Forward implication `(∀ i, n > a[i]) → fold result is true`.
      intro H
      simp only
      split
      · -- Show the first element of the list is less than `n`.
        exact H 0 (Nat.lt_succ_self _)
      · -- Show the inductive hypothesis holds for the rest of the array.
        exact ih fun i ht => H (i + 1) (Nat.succ_lt_succ_iff.mp ht)
    · -- Backward implication: `fold result is true → ∀ i, n > a[i]`.
      intro ⟨h₀, hrest⟩ i hi
      simp only
      cases i using Nat.cases_on with
      | zero => exact h₀
      | succ i =>
        -- `n` is greater than the `(i + 1)th` element of the array.
        exact ih hrest i (Nat.lt_of_succ_lt_succ hi)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Base Case**: When the array is empty (length 0), `∀ i, n > a[i]` is trivially true, so both sides of the implication are true.

2. **Inductive Step**: For a non-empty array, `Array.foldl` and `Array.foldr` on non-empty arrays essentially reduce the problem to showing:
   - The head of the list satisfies the condition (`n > a[0]`).
   - The rest of the list satisfies the condition, which follows from the inductive hypothesis using the assumption.

This proof fixes the erroneous tactic error by setting up the induction directly and working with the properties of lists that back arrays, including using `Nat` for indexing.
