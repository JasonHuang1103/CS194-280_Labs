Certainly! The main issue in your proof is that there is duplication of the theorem declaration which causes a conflict, and also there seems to be some confusion over the indices being used during the induction. Let's focus on fixing this by removing the duplicate theorem declaration and simplifying the proof logic:

```lean
theorem isGreater_spec_satisfied (n : Int) (a : Array Int) :
  isGreater_spec n a (isGreater n a) := by
  unfold isGreater isGreater_spec
  induction a using Array.inductionOn with
  | empty =>
    simp
  | push x a ih =>
    rw [Array.foldl_push, ih]
    simp
    split
    · intro h
      constructor
      · apply h
        apply Nat.lt.base
      · intro i hi
        apply h
        apply Nat.succ_lt_succ
        exact hi
    · intro ⟨hx, h⟩
      intro i
      apply Nat.casesOn i
      · exact hx
      · intro i
        exact h i
```

In this improved version:

- Removed the duplicated theorem declaration.
- Applied induction directly to the `Array a` using `Array.inductionOn`.
- Utilized pattern matching on the `Array` to decompose it and handle the cases for `a` being empty or the push case effectively. 
- Solved subgoals using pattern matching and `Nat.casesOn` appropriately for cleaner argument handling.
