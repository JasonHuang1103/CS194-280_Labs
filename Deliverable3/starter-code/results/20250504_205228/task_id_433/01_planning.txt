Below is an outline for a solution. In our plan we will:

1. Implement the function in a straightforward way using an iteration over the array. One common approach is to “fold” the array with a boolean “and” operator that, for every element x, tests whether n > x. In Lean 4 this can be done with Array.foldl. (Another possibility is to use Array.all? if available.)

2. State the specification as an equivalence: n is strictly greater than every element in the array (for all valid indices, n > a[i]!) if and only if the returned Boolean is true.

3. Prove the theorem by induction on the size of the array. The steps are:
  a. Base case: When the array is empty, the property ∀ i, i < 0 → n > a[i]! is trivially true, and our folding (or all? function) returns true.
  b. Inductive step: Assume the equivalence holds for an array a. For a new array (for example, by “pushing” a new element x on the back), show that:
   i. If the function returns true then it must be the case that n > x and the induction hypothesis holds for the original part of the array.
   ii. Conversely, if n > x and n is strictly greater than every element in the original array, then the folding returns true.
  c. In the proof we “unfold” the definitions of both isGreater and the specification, and use the properties of foldl and boolean conjunction (&&) to relate the two sides.

4. Finally, conclude that the implemented function indeed satisfies the specification.

A more detailed plan is as follows:

---------------------------------
Step 1. Implementation

We will define:

 def isGreater (n : Int) (a : Array Int) : Bool :=
  a.foldl (fun acc x => acc && (n > x)) true

Here, we start with true, then for each element check that n > x and combine the result using &&. By the properties of &&, the entire expression evaluates to true if and only if for every element in a the inequality holds.

---------------------------------
Step 2. Specification

We already have a specification in the form

 def isGreater_spec (n : Int) (a : Array Int) (result : Bool) : Prop :=
  (∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!) ↔ result

which exactly states that the Boolean result is true precisely when n > every element of the array.

---------------------------------
Step 3. Proof Outline

In the proof theorem isGreater_spec_satisfied, we need to prove the equivalence:
  ∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!  ↔ (a.foldl (λ b x => b && (n > x)) true)

Plan details:

1. Unfold the definitions of isGreater and isGreater_spec.

2. Proceed by induction on the structure (size) of the array:
 • Base Case: When a is empty (a.size = 0), the left-hand side (∀ i, i < 0 → n > a[i]!) is vacuously true, while the folding returns true. So the equivalence holds.
 • Inductive Case: Assume the statement is true for an array a and then consider the array a.push x for some integer x. Use the properties of foldl and the fact that (true && b) equals b; then show that:
  - The fold returns true if and only if (n > x) and the fold on a returns true.
  - By the inductive hypothesis, the latter is equivalent to n being greater than every element of a.
  - Hence, overall, the fold returns true exactly when n > x and n > every element of a – i.e., n is strictly greater than every element in a.push x.
3. Conclude the proof by the inductive principle.

---------------------------------
Step 4. Writing the Code

In the actual Lean file you would substitute the placeholders {{code}} and {{proof}} by the implementation and the above-indicated inductive proof. In our plan, we highlight that one must carefully manage the unfolding of definitions and use properties of foldl and boolean conjunction.

---------------------------------
Summary

The key steps are:
 1. Choosing an implementation that iterates over the array (via foldl), ensuring that for every element the condition n > element holds.
 2. Stating the specification as an equivalence (∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!) ↔ (result = true).
 3. Proving the base case for an empty array.
 4. Proving the inductive case by appending an element to the array and using the inductive hypothesis.
 5. Concluding that the function meets its specification.

This plan gives you the roadmap needed to implement the function and rigorously prove that it meets the provided specifications in Lean 4.
