Below is a detailed plan for solving the problem.

────────────────────────────
Step 1. Implementing the Function

We need a function ident : Nat → Nat that returns the same number it receives. This is the identity function. Therefore, our implementation is trivial:

• Write the body of ident as simply x.
• For example, we define: def ident (x : Nat) : Nat := x

────────────────────────────
Step 2. Writing the Specification

The specification ident_spec requires that for a natural number x and a result, the predicate holds if result = x. This ensures that ident x equals x. No additional conditions are needed.

────────────────────────────
Step 3. Proving the Specification

We must prove that theorem ident_spec_satisfied (x : Nat) : ident_spec x (ident x) holds. The key proof steps are:

• Unfold the definitions of ident and ident_spec.
    - After unfolding, the goal becomes to show that x = x.
• Use reflexivity (rfl) since x = x is true by definition.

The proof is short and straightforward.

────────────────────────────
Step 4. Filling in the Lean Template

With the above steps, we can fill in the provided template. 

────────────────────────────
Summary

Key steps:
1. Define ident such that it returns x.
2. Define the specification: ident_spec x result := result = x.
3. Prove that ident_spec x (ident x) holds by unfolding the definitions and using rfl to complete the proof.

Using this plan, the Lean code will be complete.

────────────────────────────
Final Outline (without actual code details):

Implementation:
• def ident (x : Nat) : Nat := x

Specification:
• def ident_spec (x : Nat) (result: Nat) : Prop := result = x

Proof (in theorem ident_spec_satisfied):
• Unfold the definitions using "unfold ident ident_spec"
• Conclude with "rfl" because x = x.

This plan ensures that the function and its correctness proof are simple and direct.
