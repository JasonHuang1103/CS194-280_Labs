The issue with the provided proof is twofold: First, there is a redundancy where the theorem `isDivisibleBy11_spec_satisfied` is declared twice, causing a duplication error. Second, the error message indicates unresolved goals, probably due to incorrect handling of the equivalence between the `Bool` result of `isDivisibleBy11` and the `Prop` result of `isDivisibleBy11_spec`. We need to handle the cases correctly to ensure that logical equivalence is established.

Here's the corrected proof:

```lean
theorem isDivisibleBy11_spec_satisfied (n : Int) :
  isDivisibleBy11_spec n (isDivisibleBy11 n) := by
  unfold isDivisibleBy11 isDivisibleBy11_spec
  split_ifs
  case _ h₁ =>
    constructor
    . intro _; exact h₁
    . intro _; rfl
  case _ h₂ =>
    constructor
    . intro h; exact h₂ h
    . intro h; contradiction
```

### Explanation:

- Removed the duplicate declaration of `theorem isDivisibleBy11_spec_satisfied`.
- Used `split_ifs` to handle the conditional logic based on whether `n % 11 = 0` or not.
- Ensured that each branch verifies the equivalence between the modulo condition and the boolean result.
- Adjusted the proof steps to correctly use implications and refutations for the cases (e.g., using `h₂` directly in the implication `intro h; exact h₂ h`).
