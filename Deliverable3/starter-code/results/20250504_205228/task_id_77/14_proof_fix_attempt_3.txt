Certainly! The main issue with your proof is a redundancy and a mistake in handling the split cases correctly. Additionally, the error message indicates that there is an accidental duplication of the theorems' name. Here's the corrected proof for `isDivisibleBy11_spec_satisfied`:

```lean
theorem isDivisibleBy11_spec_satisfied (n : Int) :
  isDivisibleBy11_spec n (isDivisibleBy11 n) := by
  unfold isDivisibleBy11 isDivisibleBy11_spec
  split_ifs
  case _ h₁ =>
    constructor
    . intro; exact h₁
    . intro; rfl
  case _ h₂ =>
    constructor
    . intro h; contradiction
    . intro h; exact h₂ h
```

### Key Points:

- I removed the duplicated `theorem` declaration.
- Cleaned up the split cases to directly handle the proof paths.
- Used `contradiction` correctly in the second case to derive a contradiction from `n % 11 = 0`.
- Ensured that the constructor forms are used correctly to handle the bidirectional implication.
