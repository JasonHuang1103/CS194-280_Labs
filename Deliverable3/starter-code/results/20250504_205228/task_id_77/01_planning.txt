Below is a detailed plan to develop the function and its correctness proof.

─────────────────────────────  
1. Implementation Strategy

• The function isDivisibleBy11 must take an integer n and return a Boolean indicating whether 11 divides n.  
• Since divisibility by 11 is expressed by the proposition n % 11 = 0 (where % is the modulo operation on integers), the straightforward implementation is to check if n % 11 equals 0.  
• In Lean, you can use an if-then-else statement. For example, you can write:  
  if n % 11 = 0 then true else false  
This directly returns true if n is divisible by 11, and false otherwise.

─────────────────────────────  
2. Specification Setup

• The specification (isDivisibleBy11_spec) relates the Boolean output with the mathematical statement “n % 11 = 0”.  
• It is defined as:  
  n % 11 = 0 ↔ result  
This means the returned Boolean is true exactly when n % 11 equals 0.

3. Proof Plan for isDivisibleBy11_spec_satisfied

Key steps in proving the theorem include:

a. Unfold Definitions  
 – Begin the proof by unfolding both isDivisibleBy11 and isDivisibleBy11_spec. This makes their definitions visible in the goal.

b. Analyze the if-then-else Expression  
 – The definition of isDivisibleBy11 is an if-expression that branches on (n % 11 = 0).  
 – Consider two cases:
  • Case 1: Assume n % 11 = 0. In this branch, the if-expression evaluates to true. Hence, the equivalence n % 11 = 0 ↔ true holds (the left side is assumed true).  
  • Case 2: Assume n % 11 ≠ 0. Then the if-expression evaluates to false, and you must show n % 11 = 0 ↔ false, which also holds because the left side is false.
 – Lean’s support for if expressions over decidable propositions (like equality on integers) can be utilized, and the simplification lemmas for if-expressions (like if_pos and if_neg) might be useful.

c. Formal Reasoning  
 – You might either use tactics such as "by_cases" or "split" to separately consider the two cases.  
 – Alternatively, you can use the simp tactic after unfolding the definitions, since Lean’s simp can simplify the if-then-else constructions given the condition.

4. Summary of the Steps

1. Implement isDivisibleBy11:
  – Use an if-else based on whether n % 11 equals 0.

2. Write the isDivisibleBy11_spec which equates (n % 11 = 0) with the returned Boolean.

3. Prove isDivisibleBy11_spec_satisfied by:
  a. Unfolding the definitions.
  b. Considering the two cases coming from the if-else (i.e., the condition n % 11 = 0 holding or not holding).
  c. Showing that in each case the equivalence holds.

5. A Pseudocode Sketch

The following sketch mirrors the approach:

─────────────────────────────  
Implementation:
 def isDivisibleBy11 (n : Int) : Bool :=
   if n % 11 = 0 then true else false

Specification:
 def isDivisibleBy11_spec (n : Int) (result : Bool) : Prop :=
   n % 11 = 0 ↔ result

Proof:
 theorem isDivisibleBy11_spec_satisfied (n : Int) :
   isDivisibleBy11_spec n (isDivisibleBy11 n) := by
   unfold isDivisibleBy11 isDivisibleBy11_spec
   by_cases h : n % 11 = 0
   · -- Case when h is true:
     simp [if_pos h]
   · -- Case when h is false:
     simp [if_neg h]
─────────────────────────────  

This plan shows the key insights:
 – Implementing by directly checking the modulo.
 – Unfolding definitions to expose the structure.
 – Splitting the proof into two cases where the if-then-else simplifies auto.

By following these steps, you will achieve both the function implementation and the correctness proof according to the given specification.
