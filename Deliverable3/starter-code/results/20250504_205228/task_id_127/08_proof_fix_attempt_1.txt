The error message suggests that the `unfold` tactic failed because `multiply` is already defined as `a * b`, and therefore, there's nothing to unfold for `multiply` during the proof, and trying to unfold the same thing twice is unnecessary.

Here's the corrected proof:

```lean
theorem multiply_spec_satisfied (a : Int) (b : Int) :
  multiply_spec a b (multiply a b) := by
  -- << PROOF START >>
  unfold multiply_spec
  rfl
  -- << PROOF END >>
```

This correction unfolds `multiply_spec`, which turns the goal into `multiply a b = a * b`, and since `multiply a b` is defined as `a * b`, `rfl` can be used to complete the proof.
