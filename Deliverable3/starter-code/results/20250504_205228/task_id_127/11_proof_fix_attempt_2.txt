The error you are encountering is because you have duplicated the theorem definition, which causes a conflict. Also, the inner proof is unnecessarily complex. You can simplify it by removing the duplicate theorem declaration and correctly applying the `unfold` tactic. Here is the fixed proof content:

```lean
theorem multiply_spec_satisfied (a : Int) (b : Int) :
  multiply_spec a b (multiply a b) := by
  unfold multiply multiply_spec
  rfl
``` 

This proof unfolds the definitions of `multiply` and `multiply_spec`, then applies `rfl` to show the identities are equal. You donâ€™t need to duplicate the theorem definition.
