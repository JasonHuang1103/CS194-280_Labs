Certainly! The proof error occurs due to a redundant re-declaration of the theorem `multiply_spec_satisfied`. There is also a formatting issue. Below is the corrected proof content without the redundant declaration:

```lean
theorem multiply_spec_satisfied (a : Int) (b : Int) :
  multiply_spec a b (multiply a b) := by
  unfold multiply multiply_spec
  rfl
```
