```lean
theorem hasOppositeSign_spec_satisfied (a : Int) (b : Int) :
  hasOppositeSign_spec a b (hasOppositeSign a b) := by
  unfold hasOppositeSign hasOppositeSign_spec
  apply Iff.intro
  · intro h
    simp only [Bool.of_decide_eq_true, *]
  · intro h
    rw [←Bool.of_decide_eq_true]
    exact h
```

The proof error was mostly in handling the `decide` function correctly. In Lean, when using `decide`, it's more productive to use `Bool.of_decide_eq_true` to handle the transformation between a Boolean value from `decide` and the logical propositions you are working with. Additionally, there was a duplicated block in the proof which has been corrected.
