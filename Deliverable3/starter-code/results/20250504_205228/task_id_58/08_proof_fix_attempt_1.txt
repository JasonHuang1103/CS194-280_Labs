Here's how you can fix the proof:

```lean
theorem hasOppositeSign_spec_satisfied (a : Int) (b : Int) :
  hasOppositeSign_spec a b (hasOppositeSign a b) := by
  unfold hasOppositeSign hasOppositeSign_spec
  apply Iff.intro
  · intro h
    simp only [decide_eq_true_iff, *]
  · intro h
    simp only [decide_eq_true, *] at h
    assumption
```

### Explanation of Changes
1. **`unfold`**: We still use `unfold` to expand the definitions, but note that `unfold` only works on fully-named parts of the expression. If you have something like an `Iff`, using `unfold` directly on the names won't work if the goal needs more simplification to reach the form you desire.

2. **Simplification and `decide` handling**: The use of `decide` adds a layer where you need to handle `decide_eq_true_iff` and `decide_eq_true` to simplify propositions involving `decide`. This plays a crucial role in connecting the logical propositions to the Boolean evaluations that arise from `decide`.

With these changes, the proof accurately expands and then matches both sides of the equivalence, ensuring that the boolean result of `hasOppositeSign` is handled correctly.
