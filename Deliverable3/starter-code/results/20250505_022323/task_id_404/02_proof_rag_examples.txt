Overfitting is a common problem in machine learning where a model becomes too complex and learns not only the true patterns in the data but also the noise or random fluctuations. This results in poor generalization to unseen data. Techniques like cross-validation, regularization, and pruning are often used to prevent overfitting. Regularization methods, like L2 (Ridge) or L1 (Lasso), add a penalty term to the loss function to constrain model complexity.
Reinforcement learning can be used to solve tasks such as decision making and knowledge discovery. This is due to the exploration exploitation paradigm.
One of the most common methods in aMachine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms capable of learning from and making decisions based on data. These algorithms identify patterns within data, enabling systems to improve their performance over time without explicit programming. Applications of machine learning span various domains, including image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics, making it a cornerstone of modern technological advancements.
