Below is a detailed plan for how to approach the implementation and proof.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Implementation of the Function

• We need to write a function called myMin that takes two integers, a and b, and returns the smaller integer.

• A straightforward way is to use an if–then–else statement:
  if a ≤ b then a else b

• This ensures that when a is less than or equal to b, we return a; otherwise, we return b.

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Specification of the Function

• The specification, called myMin_spec, has two parts:
  (1) The result is less than or equal to both a and b.
  (2) The result is equal to either a or b.

• In Lean, we express this as:
  (result ≤ a ∧ result ≤ b) ∧ (result = a ∨ result = b)

• This means that the minimum value really comes from the two inputs.

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. Proving that the Function Meets the Specification

The goal is to prove the theorem myMin_spec_satisfied, that for any a and b, myMin a b satisfies myMin_spec a b.

Here’s the plan to prove the theorem:

1. Unfold the definitions of myMin and myMin_spec. This will replace the definitions with their underlying code.

2. Use case analysis on the if–then–else structure in myMin.
  – In the first branch, assume a ≤ b:
   • Then myMin a b returns a.
   • You need to show: a ≤ a (which is trivial) and a ≤ b (which follows by assumption).
   • Moreover, show that the result is either a or b. In this case, it is obviously equal to a.

  – In the second branch, assume ¬(a ≤ b) which means b < a:
   • Then myMin a b returns b.
   • Show that b ≤ a (which follows from b < a) and b ≤ b (trivial).
   • Also, show that the result is either a or b. Here, it is equal to b.

3. For both cases, use tactics such as split, cases, or by simp, using the appropriate arithmetic or logical reasoning (for example, the simp tactic might automatically handle simple inequalities).

Step 4. Writing Out the Lean Code

For the implementation section in the template, you would replace {{code}} with:

  if a ≤ b then a else b

For the proof section, you would replace {{proof}} with a case analysis outline similar to:

  cases' h : (a ≤ b) with h₁ h₂  -- split into case a ≤ b and ¬(a ≤ b)
  • In the first case (h : a ≤ b), simplify and use the assumption.
  • In the second case (h : ¬(a ≤ b), hence b < a), simplify accordingly.
  • Use split to handle the conjunction in the spec.
  • Use logical tactics (exact, left, right, assumption) to complete the proof.

In Lean 4, tactics like by cases, split, and simp (or even lia for linear arithmetic) help to finish off these goals.

Step 5. Summary of Key Steps

1. Define myMin using if–then–else.
2. Write down the predicate myMin_spec that expresses the desired properties of the result.
3. In the proof of myMin_spec_satisfied:
  – Unfold both definitions.
  – Do a case split based on the condition “if a ≤ b”:
   ◦ In the first branch, verify both the inequality and that the result equals a.
   ◦ In the second branch, verify that the inequality holds and the result equals b.
4. Make use of Lean tactics to simplify and automatically handle the basic arithmetic.

By following this plan, you'll produce a Lean 4 function that correctly returns the minimum of two integers and a formal proof that the function meets the specified properties.

This detailed blueprint should guide you through the implementation and the formal verification in Lean 4.
