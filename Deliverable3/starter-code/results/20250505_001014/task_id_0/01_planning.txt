Below is a detailed plan to approach the implementation and the proof.

────────────────────────
Step 1. Implementation of the Function

• We need to define a function ident that takes a natural number x and returns a natural number.
• The specification requires that the output equals the input. Therefore, the function implementation is trivial.
• In Lean, we can simply write: ident x = x.

────────────────────────
Step 2. Specification as a Property

• The given specification ident_spec states that for a given x and some result, result = x.
• When applied to the function ident, we interpret that ident_spec x (ident x) should hold, meaning (ident x) = x.

────────────────────────
Step 3. Proving the Theorem

• The theorem ident_spec_satisfied requires us to prove that the implementation satisfies ident_spec, i.e., that ident_spec x (ident x) holds.
• Begin the proof by unfolding (or expanding) the definitions of ident and ident_spec. Once unfolded, the goal becomes showing: (x) = x.
• In Lean, this equality is immediate since any element is equal to itself. The tactic "rfl" (reflexivity) will close this goal.
• An alternative tactic would be "simp" since the simplifier also resolves basic identities such as x = x.

────────────────────────
Step 4. Putting It All Together

In the Lean file, you will:
1. Fill the implementation section with x.
2. Fill the proof section by using the reflectivity tactic "rfl" (after unfolding the definitions).

Final Lean Code Outline

Here’s an outline with placeholders replaced:

---------------------------------------------------------
import Mathlib
import Aesop

-- Implementation
def ident (x : Nat) : Nat :=
  -- << CODE START >>
  x
  -- << CODE END >>

def ident_spec (x : Nat) (result: Nat) : Prop :=
  -- << SPEC START >>
  result = x
  -- << SPEC END >>

theorem ident_spec_satisfied (x : Nat) :
  ident_spec x (ident x) := by
  -- << PROOF START >>
  unfold ident ident_spec
  rfl
  -- << PROOF END >>
---------------------------------------------------------

Summary

1. The function is defined by returning its input unchanged.
2. The specification states that the output equals x.
3. The proof unfolds the definitions, reducing the goal to proving x = x, which follows by reflexivity.

With these steps, you have a complete plan for implementing the required Lean 4 function and proving the corresponding specification.
