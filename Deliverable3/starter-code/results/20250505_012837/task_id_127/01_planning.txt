Below is a detailed plan that outlines the key steps needed to implement the function and its proof:

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Implement the Function

• Our task is to multiply two integers. In Lean, the built‐in multiplication operator for Int is available as (a * b).  
• The implementation is therefore straightforward – simply return a * b.  
• In the implementation section of the template, you simply replace {{code}} by a * b.

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Define the Specification

• The specification (multiply_spec) states that for any integers a and b, the result should equal a * b.  
• The provided template already expresses this as result = a * b in the predicate definition.

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. Prove the Specification for Your Function

• In the theorem multiply_spec_satisfied, we need to show that multiply_spec a b (multiply a b) holds – meaning that (multiply a b) = a * b.  
• The proof strategy is as follows:

  1. Unfold the definitions of both multiply and multiply_spec so that the goal becomes exactly a * b = a * b.
  2. Use the reflexivity of equality. In Lean, the tactic rfl (short for “reflexivity”) will immediately close the goal because both sides are syntactically the same after unfolding.

• You would replace the {{proof}} placeholder with rfl (or use tactics that lead to rfl).
  
──────────────────────────────
Step 4. Finalize the Lean File

• Once the function and the proof are written, check that Lean accepts the definitions and the theorem.  
• Because both the implementation and the proof are trivial (direct use of the multiplication operator and reflexivity), this should validate the correctness of your function relative to the specification.

──────────────────────────────
In summary, the plan involves:

1. Defining the multiply function as: a * b.
2. Unfolding the definitions in the theorem to reveal that the result is simply a * b.
3. Concluding the proof with the reflexive property (rfl).

By following these steps, you'll have both an implementation that fulfills the requirements and a corresponding proof that the function meets the specified behavior.
