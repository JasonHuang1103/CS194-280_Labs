Below is a high-level plan for attacking this problem, including both the implementation and the proof.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Implementing the Function

• Use the standard conditional expression (if-then-else) in Lean.  
  – If a ≤ b, then a is the smallest.  
  – Otherwise (i.e., a > b), b is the smallest.

• Thus, you would define myMin as:
  if a ≤ b then a else b

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Stating the Specification

• The predicate myMin_spec requires two things:
  1. The result is less than or equal to a and b.
  2. The result equals either a or b.

• This matches our implementation: by returning one of the two inputs, the second bullet is immediate, and our tests for ordering cover the first part.

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. Proving the Specification

• Begin the proof by unfolding the definitions for both myMin (our function) and myMin_spec.

• Then perform a case analysis on the condition (a ≤ b):
  Case 1: a ≤ b  
   – In this branch, myMin returns a.  
   – Since a ≤ a is obvious and a ≤ b is given by the hypothesis, the result satisfies result ≤ a and result ≤ b.  
   – Also, a = a, so the second part of the specification (result = a ∨ result = b) holds by left disjunction.

  Case 2: a > b  
   – In this branch, myMin returns b.  
   – Then b ≤ b is trivial, and b ≤ a follows from the fact that if a is greater than b then necessarily b ≤ a.  
   – The result equals b, so the disjunction is satisfied by the right option.

• You can complete the proof by using Lean’s tactics (e.g., by cases or simp) to cover the reasoning in both branches.

──────────────────────────────
Step 4. Summarizing the Approach

1. Write the definition:
  def myMin (a : Int) (b : Int) : Int :=
   if a ≤ b then a else b

2. Define the specification predicate, already provided:
  (def myMin_spec)

3. Prove the theorem myMin_spec_satisfied by:
  – Unfolding the definitions.
  – Splitting the proof into two cases based on whether a ≤ b or not.
  – In each branch, show both parts of myMin_spec are satisfied.

──────────────────────────────
Conclusion

Following these steps, you ensure that the implementation of myMin is correct and that the provided theorem (myMin_spec_satisfied) is rigorously verified. This plan covers both the key implementation details and the case-based reasoning needed for the proof.

This detailed plan should help guide your Lean 4 function and corresponding proof implementation.
