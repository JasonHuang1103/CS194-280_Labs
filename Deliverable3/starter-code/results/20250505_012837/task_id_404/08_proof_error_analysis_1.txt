Below is a summary of what was going wrong in your proof and how you might begin to fix it.

1. The error message tells you that Lean is “unsolved” on the goal

  ((if a ≤ b then a else b) ≤ a ∧ (if a ≤ b then a else b) ≤ b) ∧ ((b < a → b = a) ∨ (a ≤ b → a = b))

 Notice in the second conjunct the equality is simplified to an implication form. (This happens when the if‐expression is not “unfolded” in a case analysis.)

2. However, the main issue is not with your definitions (the implementation of myMin or the specification) but with the way you have written the tactic script. In Lean 4 the indentation (and bullet “·”) structure matters a lot.

 Your proof is written as

  theorem myMin_spec_satisfied (a : Int) (b : Int) :
   myMin_spec a b (myMin a b) := by
   unfold myMin myMin_spec
   simp
 split
 · split
    · by_cases h : a ≤ b
      · simp [h]
      · simp [h, not_le.1 h]
    · by_cases h : a ≤ b
      · simp [h, le_of_lt (not_le.1 h)]
      · simp [h]
 · by_cases h : a ≤ b
    · simp [h]
    · simp [h]

 Here the tactic “split” (and the bullets that follow) are not indented as part of the “by” block. In Lean’s tactic mode the entire proof “body” must be indented after “by”. Because they are not, Lean ends up parsing the “split” (and its bullet‑subscripts) outside the proof block. This is why you see an “unexpected identifier; expected command” message and an unsolved goal.

3. How to Fix It

 To fix the error you need to make sure that all of the tactics intended as part of the proof are indented correctly. For example, you could write

  theorem myMin_spec_satisfied (a : Int) (b : Int) :
   myMin_spec a b (myMin a b) := by
    unfold myMin myMin_spec
    simp
    split
    · split
      · by_cases h : a ≤ b
        · simp [h]
        · simp [h, not_le.1 h]
      · by_cases h : a ≤ b
        · simp [h, le_of_lt (not_le.1 h)]
        · simp [h]
    · by_cases h : a ≤ b
      · simp [h]
      · simp [h]

 By indenting the “split” and bullet parts so that they are clearly inside the “by” proof block, Lean will correctly see them as part of the proof script. (It is also a good idea to check that each branch actually “closes” its goal – although in this case the primary error was one of structure.)

4. To Summarize

 • The error in your proof is not a problem with the definitions of myMin or the spec but with the way the tactic proofs are structured.

 • The “split” tactic along with its bullet branches must be indented as part of the “by” block. Otherwise, Lean treats them as separate commands and then complains of “unsolved goals” and “unexpected identifier.”

A good first step is to adjust your indentation (or bullet structure) so that every tactic line is clearly nested under the “by” in the theorem statement. Then, re-check whether each branch of your case analysis indeed finishes off that branch of the goal.

This change in structure should remove the “unexpected identifier” error and (if you don’t have any other mistakes) complete the proof of myMin_spec_satisfied.
