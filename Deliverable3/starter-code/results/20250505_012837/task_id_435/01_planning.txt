Below is a detailed plan to approach both the implementation and the proof.

─────────────────────────────  
1. Implementation Plan

• The function goal is to return the last digit of any non-negative integer n.  
• To get the last digit, you simply compute (n % 10) because the remainder when dividing n by 10 is exactly the last digit in its decimal representation.  
• Therefore, the implementation in Lean is straightforward: define lastDigit n as n % 10.

─────────────────────────────  
2. Specification and Proof Strategy

• The specification (lastDigit_spec) requires two properties:
  ▸ (0 ≤ result ∧ result < 10): Ensures that the result is a digit from 0 to 9.
  ▸ n % 10 = result: Ensures that the returned result corresponds to the remainder of n modulo 10.
  
• Since our implementation defines lastDigit n as n % 10, the equality n % 10 = result holds by definition.

• The main task in the proof is then to show 0 ≤ n % 10 ∧ n % 10 < 10.

─────────────────────────────  
3. Proof Steps

(a) unfold definitions:
  ▸ Expand definitions of lastDigit and lastDigit_spec.

(b) Prove (0 ≤ n % 10):
  ▸ This follows from the property of the modulo operation on natural numbers, as the remainder must always be non-negative in Lean’s Nat type.

(c) Prove (n % 10 < 10):
  ▸ Lean's standard library includes the lemma (Nat.mod_lt n k) proving that n % k < k, provided that k > 0.  
  ▸ Here, k is 10, and we can use (Nat.mod_lt n 10) because 10 > 0 is trivially true (and Lean will accept dec_trivial or a simple numeric argument to show that).

(d) Conclude:
  ▸ Combine both parts into a conjunction and finish the proof.

─────────────────────────────  
4. Putting It All Together

(a) In the code, inside lastDigit, replace {{code}} with:
     n % 10

(b) In lastDigit_spec_satisfied, inside the proof block, after unfolding the definitions, you can apply (Nat.mod_lt n 10) (using a tactic like exact or apply Nat.mod_lt with dec_trivial for verifying 10 > 0).

─────────────────────────────  
Summary of Key Steps:

1. Implementation:
   - Write the function to return n % 10.

2. Proof:
   - Unfold the definitions for both lastDigit and lastDigit_spec.
   - Prove the non-negativity part, which is immediate.
   - Prove the upper bound using the lemma Nat.mod_lt, ensuring that n % 10 is less than 10.
   - Conclude the proof by combining both components with ∧.

This plan gives a clear road map to implement the function and complete the corresponding theorem proof in Lean 4.
