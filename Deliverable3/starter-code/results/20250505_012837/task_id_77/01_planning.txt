Below is a plan that breaks down the implementation and its accompanying proof into clear, discrete steps.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Implementation of isDivisibleBy11  
──────────────────────────────
• The goal is to write a function that returns true if an integer n is divisible by 11 and false otherwise.
• The mathematical statement “n is divisible by 11” is equivalent to n % 11 = 0.
• In Lean 4, since equality on integers is decidable, you can write a conditional check:
  if n % 11 = 0 then true else false.
• This directly implements the required logic in a Boolean-valued function.

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Specification Definition  
──────────────────────────────
• The provided specification is:
  n % 11 = 0 ↔ result.
• This means that the Boolean result should be true exactly when n % 11 = 0, and false otherwise.
• Our implementation from Step 1 already mirrors this behavior.

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. Proof of the Specification  
──────────────────────────────
• The theorem is: 
  isDivisibleBy11_spec n (isDivisibleBy11 n),
  which unfolds to proving:
  n % 11 = 0 ↔ (if n % 11 = 0 then true else false).
• To prove this, one may proceed as follows:
  1. Unfold the definitions of isDivisibleBy11 and isDivisibleBy11_spec.
  2. Do a case analysis or simple “if” simplification based on the decision procedure for n % 11 = 0.
   a. If n % 11 = 0, then the if-condition yields true. Therefore, the equivalence becomes (n % 11 = 0 ↔ true), which holds since the left-hand side is our assumption.
   b. If n % 11 ≠ 0, then the function yields false. Now the equivalence reduces to (n % 11 = 0 ↔ false). Since n % 11 ≠ 0, the left-hand side is false and false ↔ false holds.
  3. Use built-in simplification tactics (for instance, simp or split followed by assumption) to complete the proof.
• The structure of the proof is very straightforward once the condition is analyzed.

──────────────────────────────
Step 4. Writing Up the Lean Code  
──────────────────────────────
• You will place the code for isDivisibleBy11 between the provided markers.
• Then, fill in the proof between the corresponding proof markers.
• The final file will import Mathlib and Aesop, define the function and specification, and then state and prove that the implementation satisfies the specification.
  
──────────────────────────────
Summary  
──────────────────────────────
1. Define isDivisibleBy11 as a function that returns if n % 11 is 0 through a simple if-then-else.
2. The spec is precisely that n % 11 = 0 if and only if the result is true.
3. The proof will simply unfold the definitions and does a case analysis on the condition (n % 11 = 0) to show the equivalence holds.
  
Following these steps will lead to a correct Lean 4 implementation and its associated proof.
