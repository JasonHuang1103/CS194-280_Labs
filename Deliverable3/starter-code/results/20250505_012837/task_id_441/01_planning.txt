Below is a detailed plan outlining the approach for both the implementation of the function and the corresponding proof.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Implement the Function

• Understand the formula: The surface area (A) of a cube with edge length size is given by A = 6 * size².
• Write the function: In Lean 4, define the function cubeSurfaceArea that accepts an integer size and returns 6 * size * size.
• Notice that you can directly use multiplication on integers, so the implementation is straightforward.

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Define the Specification

• The specification is a property that for a given size and result, result = 6 * size * size.
• This property is captured in the definition cubeSurfaceArea_spec.
• This definition can be used later in the theorem to connect the function implementation with the expected result.

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. Prove the Theorem

• The theorem cubeSurfaceArea_spec_satisfied should show that for any cube edge size, the computed surface area meets the specification.
• In the proof:
  - Unfold both the definitions of cubeSurfaceArea and cubeSurfaceArea_spec.
  - After unfolding, you will reveal the equality that needs to be proven, namely that (6 * size * size) = (6 * size * size).
  - Lean's simplifier (or just a reflexivity argument) will then notice that both sides are definitionally equal.
• Use either the tactic rfl (reflexivity), simp, or any similar tactic to close the proof.

──────────────────────────────
Step 4. Write Out the Final Code

• Integrate the function, specification, and theorem into the template.
• Your final Lean code will have:
  - The implementation of cubeSurfaceArea.
  - The definition of the cubeSurfaceArea_spec.
  - And the theorem with the proof that unfolds the definitions and uses reflexivity or similar to finish the argument.

──────────────────────────────
Summary of Key Steps

1. Use the formula A = 6 * size * size in the function definition.
2. Define a specification property ensuring the computed value agrees with the formula.
3. In the proof:
   - Unfold definitions to expose the underlying arithmetic expression.
   - Use reflexivity (or a simplification tactic) to show the equality.
4. Ensure the proof remains valid by not assuming any extraneous properties beyond the given arithmetic operations.

Following this plan, you can now implement the function and proof in Lean 4 confidently.
