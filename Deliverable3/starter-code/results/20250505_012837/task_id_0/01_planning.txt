Below is a detailed plan for the implementation and proof:

1. Implementation
   • The function is meant to just return the input natural number.
   • Since the identity function simply returns its argument, implement it by writing:
     
         def ident (x : Nat) : Nat := x

2. Specification
   • The specification is given by ident_spec where for a number x and a result, the condition is result = x.
   • This is already provided in the template:
     
         def ident_spec (x : Nat) (result: Nat) : Prop :=
           result = x

3. Proof of Specification
   • The theorem ident_spec_satisfied needs to prove that for all x, ident_spec x (ident x) holds.
   • By unfolding the definition of ident and ident_spec, the goal reduces to proving x = x.
   • This equality is trivially true, so the proof can be completed by reflexivity (using the tactic “rfl”).

4. Putting It All Together
   • In the implementation section of the template, replace the placeholder with x.
   • In the proof section, after unfolding definitions, apply “rfl” to close the goal.

The key steps are:
- Implement ident as the identity function.
- Use unfold to reduce the goal.
- Use the reflexivity tactic to finish the proof.

This structured approach guarantees that the specification is satisfied by the function, as the function simply returns its input and the equality x = x is automatically true.
