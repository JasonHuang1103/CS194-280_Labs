Below is a detailed outline of how to solve the problem by both writing the function and then proving its specification.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Implementation Plan

1. Define the function isGreater.
   • The function takes two parameters: an integer n and an array a.
   • Its goal is to check whether “n” is strictly greater than every element in a.
2. Use an existing array iterator if possible.
   • Lean’s Array API contains functions like all? (or similar “forall” functions) that check if a predicate holds for every element.
   • For example, we can set:
     
       def isGreater (n : Int) (a : Array Int) : Bool :=
         a.all? (fun x => n > x)
     
     This code uses a lambda function that, given an element x of a, returns the Boolean n > x.
3. Edge case: When the array is empty, the universal condition “for all x in a, n > x” trivially holds. (This is the standard behavior of a universal quantification over an empty set.) The all? function should already deliver true for an empty array.

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Specification and Proof Plan

The specification is stated as:
  
  ∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!  ↔ (result = true)

That is: the result of isGreater must be true if and only if n is strictly greater than every element (accessed by index) in a.

The proof plan is as follows:

1. Unfold Definitions:
   • Start by expanding the definitions in the proof.
   • Replace isGreater n a with its definition (using a.all?).
   • Expand the definition of our specification “isGreater_spec” so that both sides of the equivalence become apparent.
2. Relate the array predicate and the universal statement:
   • Argue that a.all? (fun x => n > x) returns true exactly when every element x of a satisfies n > x. In Lean terms, there is (or one may prove) a lemma showing that:
       
         a.all? p = true ↔ ∀ i, i < a.size → p (a[i]!)
       
     with p defined as λ x, n > x.
   • Use (or prove) this lemma to establish the connection between the Boolean result of “all?” and the logical statement “∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!”.

3. Handle the boolean equivalence:
   • Once the above equivalence is in place, the two sides of the specification match exactly.
   • Proceed by doing a case analysis on a.all? or by rewriting using known lemmas about “all?” (e.g. if Mathlib provides an “Array.all?_iff” or similar lemma).

4. Conclude the proof:
   • After rewriting, the equivalence should be a direct consequence of the definition of all?, and you can finish the theorem proof.

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. Summary

• For the function, use the built-in all? method on arrays to iterate over each element with the predicate (fun x => n > x).

• For the proof:
   - Unfold both definitions (isGreater and isGreater_spec).
   - Show that a.all? (fun x => n > x) equals true exactly when every index i with i < a.size satisfies n > a[i]! by either invoking a known lemma or by induction on the size of the array.
   - Deal with the empty array case automatically (since “forall” over an empty set is true).

This plan gives you a roadmap both to write the Lean 4 code and the accompanying proof that your implementation meets the specification.

Example Skeleton in Lean 4

Below is how the final skeleton might look (without all details of the proof filled in):

------------------------------------------------
import Mathlib
import Aesop

-- Implementation using the all? method.
def isGreater (n : Int) (a : Array Int) : Bool :=
  a.all? (fun x => n > x)

-- Specification: n is greater than every element in a if and only if isGreater returns true.
def isGreater_spec (n : Int) (a : Array Int) (result : Bool) : Prop :=
  (∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!) ↔ result

theorem isGreater_spec_satisfied (n : Int) (a : Array Int) :
  isGreater_spec n a (isGreater n a) := by
  -- Unfold definitions
  unfold isGreater isGreater_spec
  -- At this point, one would use a lemma that relates a.all? (fun x => n > x)
  -- with (∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!) (or prove the equivalence by induction).
  -- << PROOF DETAILS HERE >>

------------------------------------------------

This outline should guide you through a complete working solution in Lean 4.

Final Notes

Key aspects of your solution include:
• Recognizing that “forall” in our specification corresponds exactly to the semantics of Array.all?.
• Unfolding the definitions and using or proving the equivalence between the Boolean output and the universal property.
• Ensuring that edge cases (like an empty array) are handled as expected by the built-in all? function.

This plan carefully presents the approach for both the implementation and the proof of correctness.
