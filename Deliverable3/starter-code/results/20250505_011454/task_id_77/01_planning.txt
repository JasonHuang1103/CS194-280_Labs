Below is a detailed plan that breaks the problem into two parts: writing the function (and its specification) and then proving that the function meets the specification.

─────────────────────────────  
1. Implementation Plan

• The function should take an integer n, compute the remainder when divided by 11, and return true if and only if the remainder is zero.  
  – Lean’s built‐in (%) operator gives the remainder.  
  – To test if this remainder is zero, one can write (n % 11 == 0) where “==” is the boolean equality check.  
  – Therefore, the intended definition is  
    def isDivisibleBy11 (n : Int) : Bool := n % 11 == 0

─────────────────────────────  
2. Specification

• The given specification states that for any integer n and a boolean result, the predicate  
  n % 11 = 0 ↔ result  
  must hold.  
• In our case we want to show that  
  n % 11 = 0 ↔ (n % 11 == 0)  
  so that the specification “isDivisibleBy11_spec” holds on the implementation.

─────────────────────────────  
3. Proof Plan

The theorem to prove is:  
  theorem isDivisibleBy11_spec_satisfied (n : Int) : isDivisibleBy11_spec n (isDivisibleBy11 n)  
After unfolding definitions, this becomes proving  
  n % 11 = 0 ↔ (n % 11 == 0).

Key steps in the proof:

• Step 3.1: Unfold the definitions of isDivisibleBy11 and isDivisibleBy11_spec to expose the equivalence we need to prove.  
  After unfolding, the goal becomes: (n % 11 = 0) ↔ (n % 11 == 0)

• Step 3.2: Use the fact that for integers, the boolean equality (==) is defined to decide the equality between two integers.  
  Lean (and Mathlib) provides a lemma (or the necessary decidability structure) that shows that for integers a and b,  
    a = b ↔ (a == b)  
  One way to proceed is by applying such a lemma (for example, a lemma like Int.beq_eq may exist or you can prove the equivalence by case analysis on decide (a = b)).  
  If no ready-made lemma is available, the proof may unfold by splitting into the two implications:
   • If n % 11 = 0, then by the definition of “==” (or by computation of decide), n % 11 == 0 returns true.
   • Conversely, if n % 11 == 0 returns true, then by the correctness of the decision procedure we also have n % 11 = 0.
  
• Step 3.3: Complete the proof by either invoking a known lemma or by performing a case analysis on the decidability of the equality.

4. Summary of the Plan

A. Write the function:
  def isDivisibleBy11 (n : Int) : Bool := n % 11 == 0

B. Write the specification as given:
  def isDivisibleBy11_spec (n : Int) (result : Bool) : Prop := n % 11 = 0 ↔ result

C. For the proof theorem, begin by unfolding the definitions. Then prove that:
  n % 11 = 0 ↔ (n % 11 == 0)
by relying on the connection between the proposition (n % 11 = 0) and its decision (n % 11 == 0). Use either an existing lemma (e.g. Int.beq_eq) or perform a case analysis using Lean’s decidability machinery. 

─────────────────────────────  
5. Additional Considerations

• Make sure that the proper modules (Mathlib, Aesop, etc.) are imported so that the decidability of "=" on Int is available.  
• The proof may be as short as “by simp” if the right simp rules are in place, or it might require an explicit or rewrite tactic using the associated lemma.

This plan outlines both how to write the function and how to prove that the function meets the specification. You can now proceed to code the Lean 4 implementation and fill in the proof using the outline above.
