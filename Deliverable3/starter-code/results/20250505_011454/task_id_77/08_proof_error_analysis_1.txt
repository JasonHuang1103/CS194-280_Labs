The mathematics in your proof isn’t wrong at all—the error comes from how the tactics are laid out. In Lean 4, all the tactics inside a tactic block (i.e. after the “by” in a proof) must be indented uniformly so that they are clearly understood to be part of the same block. In your code, the first couple of tactics (like

  unfold isDivisibleBy11 isDivisibleBy11_spec  
  simp

) are indented properly, but then the following tactics

rw [Int.ediv_eq_iff_eq_mul_right, mul_comm]  
apply Int.ne_of_ne_zero  
norm_num

are not indented with respect to the “by” block. Because of that, Lean ends the proof early and sees the identifier “rw” at the top level (where it expects a command or declaration), which triggers the error:

  error: unexpected identifier; expected command

To fix this, simply indent all lines that are part of the proof block uniformly. For example:

------------------------------------------------------------
theorem isDivisibleBy11_spec_satisfied (n : Int) :
  isDivisibleBy11_spec n (isDivisibleBy11 n) := by
  -- << PROOF START >>
  unfold isDivisibleBy11 isDivisibleBy11_spec
  simp
  rw [Int.ediv_eq_iff_eq_mul_right, mul_comm]
  apply Int.ne_of_ne_zero
  norm_num
  -- << PROOF END >>
------------------------------------------------------------

This way, Lean knows that “rw”, “apply”, and “norm_num” are all inside the same proof block, and it will parse them correctly.

In summary, the error is due to inconsistent indentation in your tactic block. Uniformly indenting all of the tactics inside the “by” block resolves the issue.
