Here's a detailed plan to approach the implementation and proof:

1. Implementation of ident:
   • The function ident is supposed to return the same natural number that it receives as input. Thus, the simplest approach is to define ident x to be x itself.
   • In Lean 4, you can simply write: ident x := x.

2. Specification predicate (ident_spec):
   • The predicate ident_spec x result should hold when result equals x.
   • The given specification is already “result = x.” No changes are needed here.

3. Proof of the specification theorem (ident_spec_satisfied):
   • You need to show that for any natural number x, the property ident_spec x (ident x) holds. That is, you need to show that ident x (which is defined as x) is equal to x.
   • Unfold the definitions of ident and ident_spec.
   • Once unfolded, the goal should reduce to proving x = x, which is true by the reflexivity of equality.
   • In Lean, the reflexivity tactic (rfl) will finish the proof.

4. Key steps summary:
   • Replace the placeholder in the ident function definition with “x” (the identity function).
   • In the theorem ident_spec_satisfied, after unfolding the definitions, use the reflexivity tactic (rfl) to close the proof.

The final code implementation and proof will look like:

--------------------------
import Mathlib
import Aesop

-- Implementation
def ident (x : Nat) : Nat :=
  -- << CODE START >>
  x
  -- << CODE END >>

def ident_spec (x : Nat) (result : Nat) : Prop :=
  -- << SPEC START >>
  result = x
  -- << SPEC END >>

theorem ident_spec_satisfied (x : Nat) :
  ident_spec x (ident x) := by
  -- << PROOF START >>
  unfold ident ident_spec;
  rfl
  -- << PROOF END >>

--------------------------

This plan ensures that:
- The ident function is implemented as the identity function, returning the input unchanged.
- The proof unfolds the definitions to reduce the goal to proving x = x, which is trivial by reflexivity (rfl).
