Below is a step‐by‐step plan outlining how to approach the implementation and the accompanying proof.

───────────────────────────────  
Step 1. Understanding the Problem  
───────────────────────────────

• The task is to define a Lean function, multiply, that takes two integers (a and b) and returns their product.  
• We also have a specification multiply_spec stating that the output must equal a * b.  
• The theorem multiply_spec_satisfied needs to show that multiply indeed produces a * b for any integers a and b.

───────────────────────────────  
Step 2. Implementing the Function  
───────────────────────────────

• The natural and simplest definition for multiply is to use the built-in multiplication operator for integers provided by Lean.  
• Therefore, we set multiply a b to be equal to a * b.  
• In the Lean code template, replace the placeholder with:  
  a * b

───────────────────────────────  
Step 3. Analyzing the Specification  
───────────────────────────────

• The specification multiply_spec is defined by the predicate: result = a * b.  
• This directly ties the correctness of multiply to the property that (multiply a b) = a * b.

───────────────────────────────  
Step 4. Proving the Theorem  
───────────────────────────────

• The theorem multiply_spec_satisfied states that:  
  multiply_spec a b (multiply a b)  
which by the definition of multiply_spec is:  
  multiply a b = a * b.

• Since the implementation of multiply is defined as a * b, the theorem simplifies to:  
  a * b = a * b.

• This equality holds by definition (or by reflexivity, using the rfl tactic).

• The proof can be written by unfolding the definitions of multiply and multiply_spec and then closing the goal with rfl.

───────────────────────────────  
Step 5. Constructing the Proof  
───────────────────────────────

• Start the theorem proof by unfolding the definitions (using “unfold”) if needed.  
• After unfolding, the goal will simplify to the obvious equality a * b = a * b.  
• Use the “rfl” tactic to complete the proof (rfl stands for “reflexivity”, asserting that any term is equal to itself).

───────────────────────────────  
Summary  
───────────────────────────────

1. Replace the placeholder in the function implementation with a * b.  
2. In the theorem, after unfolding, observe the equality becomes trivial.  
3. Use rfl to close the proof.

Following these steps ensures that the multiply function is correctly implemented and that its correctness (as per the specification) is formally verified.

This plan provides you with detailed instructions to implement and prove the function meets its specification in Lean 4.
