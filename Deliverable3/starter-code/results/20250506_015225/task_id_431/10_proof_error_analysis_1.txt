Below is an analysis of the error and its root cause, with step‐by‐step reasoning:

──────────────────────────────
1. Which tactic is failing and why

The error message complains (among other things) about unsolved goals in the two subcases of the ↔ proof (labeled “case mp” and “case mpr”) and then later “unexpected token ‘·’”. In our proof we used Iff.intro to split the goal into two implications. However, the proof “bullets” following Iff.intro turn out to be handling the wrong directions. In other words, the proof is “swapped”: the first bullet is written under the assumption for one direction but uses tactics (such as a.exists_any) that expect the opposite assumption. This mismatch causes type‐errors and leaves unsolved goals. (In addition, Lean got confused by the bullet “·” token because the structure and indentation of the proof did not match Lean’s expectations.)

──────────────────────────────
2. Consider the proof state at that point

After “unfold hasCommonElement hasCommonElement_spec” and “apply Iff.intro”, Lean creates two subgoals:
 • (∃ i j, …) → (a.any (λ x => b.any (λ y => x = y)) = true)    [“mp” direction]
 • (a.any (λ x => b.any (λ y => x = y)) = true) → (∃ i j, …)    [“mpr” direction]

Examine the first bullet: its goal is to show that if a common element exists then the boolean function returns true. But the provided tactic block starting with “intro h” then immediately calls “a.exists_any h”. The lemma a.exists_any (or a.any_spec) is meant to extract an element from the array given that “a.any … = true” holds. In the current subgoal, h is only assumed to be an existence proof, not a proof that a.any … is true.

Similarly, in the second bullet the assumption is “rintro ⟨i, j, hi, hj, heq⟩”, that is, we assume a common element exists, and then we try to “apply” a.any_spec.2 to deduce that a.any … = true. This is precisely the opposite of what the second subgoal requires.

──────────────────────────────
3. Does the proof approach match the specification?

The intended specification (hasCommonElement_spec) says that
  (∃ i j, ...common element exists…) ↔ (hasCommonElement a b = true)
so we must prove both:
 • If a common element exists, then the method returns true.
 • If the method returns true, then a common element exists.

The intended approach is sound but the proof “bullets” are written in (“reverse”) swapped order: the tactics written in the first bullet actually prove the implication “a.any = true → ∃ i j, …”, and the second bullet is intended to prove “∃ i j, … → a.any = true”. Because the order is reversed relative to the goals produced by Iff.intro, the tactics do not match the expected assumptions and conclusions.

──────────────────────────────
4. Identify any type mismatches or incorrect assumptions

There are two key mismatches:
 (a) In the first branch of the proof (the “mp” branch), the goal is to show
  (∃ i j, …) → (a.any … = true)
but the proof immediately does “intro h” and then “obtain ⟨x, hx⟩ := a.exists_any h”. The lemma a.exists_any expects a proof that a.any … is true (i.e. the boolean computation), not a proof that there exists an index satisfying a certain property.
 
 (b) In the second branch (the “mpr” branch), the assumption is a proof that a.any … = true, but the tactic “rintro ⟨i, j, …⟩” indicates that the assumption has been “unpacked” as if it were the existence of a common element.
 
These mismatches are exactly due to the swapped order of the two implications: using the wrong lemmas (or wrong direction of lemmas like any_spec) for the given assumptions leads to type errors.

──────────────────────────────
5. Consider alternative proof strategies

One way to fix the issue is to swap the order of the two bullet proofs so that the assumptions in each branch match the corresponding lemma:
 • First, prove “(a.any … = true) → (∃ i j, …)” by using a.exists_any (or a.any_spec) to extract a witness.
 • Second, prove “(∃ i j, …) → (a.any … = true)” by constructing the existence of a common element “inside” the any call via a.any_spec.2 and b.any_spec.2.

Another approach is to use the constructor tactic for ↔ directly (or to use “constructor” together with standard lemmas from Mathlib about array.any_spec) so that the structure of the proof precisely mirrors the specification. Finally, verify that the bullet symbols (∙ or ·) and indentation are correctly formatted; in Lean 4 the bullet “·” must be used in a consistent and properly indented way so that Lean’s parser correctly understands the split into subgoals.

──────────────────────────────
Conclusion: Detailed Analysis and Direction for Fixing

The root cause of the error is that the two directions of the ↔ proof have been “swapped.” The proof mistakenly applies tactics for “a.any = true → ∃ i j, …” in the branch whose goal is “∃ i j, … → a.any = true” and vice-versa. In addition, improper bullet usage causes confusion for Lean’s parser.

To fix the error, one should:
 • Swap the order of the two bullet proofs so that the first bullet handles the direction “a.any … = true → ∃ i j, …” and the second bullet handles “(∃ i j, …) → (a.any … = true)”.
 • Verify the indentation and use of bullet symbols so that Lean properly recognizes the structure.
 • Rely on the existing lemmas (like a.any_spec and b.any_spec) in the correct direction according to the hypothesis available in each subgoal.

With these corrections the proof strategy will match the specification and the type mismatches will be resolved.
