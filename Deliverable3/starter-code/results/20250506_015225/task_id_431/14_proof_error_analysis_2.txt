Below is a step‐by‐step diagnosis of the issues in your proof.

─────────────────────────────  
1. Tactic failure:  
─────────────────────────────  
The error message reports “unsolved goals” in the direction proofs and then complains about an “unexpected token ‘·’”. In your proof you begin the two directions by writing

  apply Iff.intro  
  · rintro ⟨i, j, hi, hj, heq⟩  
  …  

Here two things go wrong. First, the bullet “·” is not being parsed correctly (Lean 4 can use bullets, but in this context the bullet must be placed correctly or you can use tactics without bullets). Second, when you call “a.any_spec.2 ⟨_, hi, b.any_spec.2 ⟨_, hj, heq⟩⟩” you leave “_” placeholders that Lean does not fill in automatically. In other words, you are not providing an explicit witness for the existential quantifiers.

─────────────────────────────  
2. Proof state at the failing point:  
─────────────────────────────  
After “apply Iff.intro”, Lean expects you to prove two implications:  
  (∃ i j, i < a.size ∧ j < b.size ∧ a[i]! = b[j]!) → …  
  and … → (∃ i j, i < a.size ∧ j < b.size ∧ a[i]! = b[j]!).  
In the first direction you have assumed ⟨i, j, hi, hj, heq⟩ but then you attempt to “apply a.any_spec.2 ⟨_, hi, b.any_spec.2 ⟨_, hj, heq⟩⟩”.  
The predicate “a.any_spec.2” expects a witness for the existential in “a.any p = true ↔ ∃ i, i < a.size ∧ p (a[i]!)”. Here p is defined as “λ x => b.any (λ y => decide (x = y))”. In order to supply a witness you must use the actual indices. For example, you should provide “i” for the outer existential and “j” for the inner one rather than underscores.
  
─────────────────────────────  
3. Does the proof approach match the specification?  
─────────────────────────────  
Yes, the high‐level idea is correct. You want to show that “hasCommonElement a b” equals true if and only if there exists an index i in a and an index j in b such that a[i]! = b[j]!. However, the details must be filled in carefully using the “any_spec” lemmas (or similar facts about Array.any) and by providing explicit witnesses.

─────────────────────────────  
4. Type mismatches or incorrect assumptions:  
─────────────────────────────  
There are two kinds of mistakes here:  
• The use of “⟨_, hi, b.any_spec.2 ⟨_, hj, heq⟩⟩” does not provide concrete witnesses. The underscore placeholders leave the existential witness “unknown”, and Lean cannot “guess” them.  
• The bullet symbol “·” appears in a position where Lean expects a tactic command. (In Lean 4 you can use bullet notation, but you must be consistent with layout or use the “by” keyword to start a block.)  

─────────────────────────────  
5. Alternative proof strategies:  
─────────────────────────────  
Instead of leaving underscores, you should explicitly write the witnesses. For example, in the first branch (→) you could write:
  
  rintro ⟨i, j, hi, hj, heq⟩  
  apply a.any_spec.2 ⟨i, hi, b.any_spec.2 ⟨j, hj, heq⟩⟩

Similarly, in the second branch (←), ensure that any use of “exists_any” (if that is a defined lemma) is available and properly applied. Alternatively, you can explicitly destruct the result from “a.any_spec” and “b.any_spec” instead of relying on an “exists_any” method.

─────────────────────────────  
Conclusion – Root Cause and Fix Direction:  
─────────────────────────────  
The root cause of the error is that the proof leaves “holes” in the existential witnesses (using underscores) and the bullet “·” is not correctly placed or recognized in the current proof script. Lean’s “any_spec” expects you to supply the actual index values (in this case i and j) so that the existential statement is fully instantiated. 

To fix the proof, replace the underscores with the explicit variables. For example:

  apply Iff.intro
  · rintro ⟨i, j, hi, hj, heq⟩  
    apply a.any_spec.2 ⟨i, hi, b.any_spec.2 ⟨j, hj, heq⟩⟩
  · intro h  
    obtain ⟨x, hx⟩ := a.exists_any h  
    obtain ⟨y, hy, heq⟩ := b.exists_any hx  
    exact ⟨x, y, hx, hy, heq⟩

Moreover, ensure that your bullet notation fits Lean 4’s expected style or remove the bullets in favor of a “begin … end” block or “by” blocks.  

This change should resolve the “unsolved goal” issues and the “unexpected token ‘·’” error.
