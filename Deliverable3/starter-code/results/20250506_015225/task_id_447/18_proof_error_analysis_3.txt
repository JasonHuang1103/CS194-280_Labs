Below is a step‐by‐step analysis of the error and what is going wrong in your proof.

──────────────────────────────
1. Identifying Which Tactic Is Failing and Why

Your goal after unfolding is a conjunction, namely
  (result.size = a.size) ∧ (∀ i, i < a.size → (Array.map (fun x => x * x * x) a)[i]! = a[i]! * a[i]! * a[i]!)

You call

  simp [Array.size_map]

hoping to “solve” the size equation. (In Mathlib the size–preservation lemma is usually given by such a simp lemma.) However, even if that part is simplified, Lean still sees that the whole goal is a conjunction. Since you haven’t explicitly split the conjunction with tactics like constructor, and you then use

  intro i hi

Lean is then trying to apply that tactic to one of the subgoals (namely the universal property) while the other subgoal remains unsolved. The error “unsolved goals” means that when the tactic block ended, at least one of the conjuncts was left unproved.

──────────────────────────────
2. Considering the Proof State at That Point

After unfolding cubeElements and cubeElements_spec the goal is something like:

  Goal: (Array.map (λ x, x * x * x) a).size = a.size ∧ (∀ i, i < a.size → (Array.map (λ x, x * x * x) a)[i]! = a[i]! * a[i]! * a[i]!)

Your call to simp [Array.size_map] likely simplifies the first conjunct (using the lemma that mapping over an array preserves the size) but it does not discharge the second conjunct. Then your “intro i hi” starts a proof for the ∀ statement (the second conjunct) but there is no tactic splitting the conjunction – one of the two conjuncts remains pending.

──────────────────────────────
3. Checking if the Proof Approach Matches the Specification

The specification requires proving two facts:
 (a) The size is preserved.
 (b) For every valid index i, the element in the mapped (cubed) array equals the cube of the corresponding element.

Your proof does not explicitly separate these two parts. Instead, you “unfold” the definition and then use simp, assuming it will automatically “peel off” the ∧ and allow you to work on the universal quantification. Lean expects you to split the goal so that each part is proved separately.

──────────────────────────────
4. Identifying Type Mismatches or Incorrect Assumptions

One potential source of confusion is your use of the rewrite rule
  rw [Array.getElem_map]
Make sure that the lemma name is correct (in some versions of the library it might be called Array.get_map) and that it is applicable for the notation you are using (the “!” syntax). Even if that rewrite is fine, the main problem is not a type mismatch in the rewrite but a mis-organization of the proof: you did not split the conjunction.

──────────────────────────────
5. Considering Alternative Proof Strategies

One common way to prove a conjunction is to “split” it explicitly. For example, you can write:

  theorem cubeElements_spec_satisfied (a : Array Int) :
   cubeElements_spec a (cubeElements a) := by
   constructor
   · simp [Array.size_map]
   · intro i hi
     rw [Array.getElem_map] -- or possibly Array.get_map if that is the correct name
     rfl

This “constructor” (or “split”) tactic tells Lean “I will give a proof for each conjunct separately.” Then you can focus on one goal at a time.

──────────────────────────────
Conclusion and Root Cause

The root cause of the error is that your tactic sequence does not split the conjunction into its two parts. As a result, when you write “intro i hi” you are only addressing the second part, leaving the first part (or possibly a leftover “unsolved goal”) undone. Furthermore, slight naming issues (such as the name of the lemma for mapping over indices) might add confusion.

Suggested Direction for Fixing the Proof

• Explicitly split the proof of the conjunction. For example, replace your tactic block with something like:

  theorem cubeElements_spec_satisfied (a : Array Int) :
   cubeElements_spec a (cubeElements a) := by
   constructor
   · simp [Array.size_map]  -- Proves the size equality.
   · intro i hi         -- Now separately prove the universal quantification.
     rw [Array.getElem_map]  -- (Make sure this lemma is available and correctly named.)
     rfl

• Verify that the renaming or use of the “map”–lookup lemma indeed has the correct name and applies as expected.
• Ensure that all tactics are correctly indented inside the “by” block so that Lean treats them as sequential parts of the same proof block.

By splitting the conjunction and handling each part with appropriate tactics, the unsolved goal error will be resolved.
