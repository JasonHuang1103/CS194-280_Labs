Below is a detailed walkthrough of our thought process and plan, followed by the planned Lean code.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Understanding the Function Specification

• The function accepts an array of integers.
• For every element in the array, we are to compute its cube (i.e. x³ = x * x * x).
• The resulting array must have the same length as the input array.
• For every index i, the element at that index in the output array must equal the cube of the input array’s element at i.

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Breaking Down the Problem

A. Implementation Subproblem  
   • We need to “map” a function over the array.  
   • In Lean 4, Array has a built-in map method. We can simply write:
     a.map (fun x => x * x * x)
     This will traverse the array and replace each element with its cube.

B. Proof Subproblem  
   • Our specification (cubeElements_spec) requires two properties:  
     1. The size of the array returned by cubeElements is the same as the input array.
     2. For every index i that is within bounds, the element at that index is the cube of the input element.
   • The proof will proceed by unfolding our definitions and then proving each conjunct:
     - For the size property, we can use the fact that the map operation preserves the size (typically, a lemma like Array.size_map is available).
     - For the element-wise property, we use the lemma about array map: for any i < a.size, (a.map f)[i]! = f(a[i]!). In our case, f is x ↦ x * x * x.

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. Input Types, Edge Cases, and Expected Behavior

• Input: Any array of integers.  
• Edge Cases:  
   - Empty array: mapping over an empty array will yield an empty array, and the property holds vacuously.
   - Non-empty array: every element is processed independently.
• We do not need special handling because the library methods take care of these, as the map function is defined for all arrays.

──────────────────────────────
Step 4. Proof Techniques

• We will use tactic-based proof.  
• After unfolding our definitions, we need to prove an “and” (∧) statement:
   - Use the constructor rule (e.g., constructor, exact, intro) for conjunction.  
• For the element function part, we use a lemma corresponding to Array.map (typically named Array.get_map) which tells us that for any valid index i, (a.map f)[i]! = f (a[i]!).

──────────────────────────────
Step 5. Similar Patterns from Examples

• The provided examples show use of bullet notation and tactics like “intro” and “exact”.  
• We will mimic this style to prove both parts of the specification.

──────────────────────────────
Detailed Plan

Implementation:
1. Define cubeElements to be a.map (fun x => x * x * x).

Proof:
1. Unfold the definitions of cubeElements and cubeElements_spec.
2. Prove the size equality by invoking the lemma (typically Array.size_map).
3. For each index i that is less than the size, use Array.get_map to justify that (a.map (fun x => x * x * x))[i]! equals a[i]! * a[i]! * a[i]! .
4. Use the tactics “constructor”, “intro” and “exact” to structure the proof.

Final Lean 4 Code

Below is the complete Lean 4 code according to our plan:

--------------------------------------------------
import Mathlib
import Aesop

-- Implementation
def cubeElements (a : Array Int) : Array Int :=
  -- Use Array.map to replace each element by its cube.
  a.map (fun x => x * x * x)

-- Specification: The output array has the same size as the input, 
-- and every element is the cube of the corresponding input element.
def cubeElements_spec (a : Array Int) (result : Array Int) : Prop :=
  (result.size = a.size) ∧
  (∀ i, i < a.size → result[i]! = a[i]! * a[i]! * a[i]!)

-- Theorem: cubeElements meets its specification.
theorem cubeElements_spec_satisfied (a : Array Int) :
  cubeElements_spec a (cubeElements a) := by
  -- Unfold the definitions.
  unfold cubeElements cubeElements_spec
  -- Split the proof in two parts.
  constructor
  · -- Part 1: Prove that the sizes are equal.
    -- Array.map preserves the size.
    exact Array.size_map _
  · -- Part 2: Prove the element-wise property.
    intro i hi
    -- By the property of Array.map, for each i, the mapped value is just
    -- (fun x => x * x * x) (a[i]!) which is a[i]! * a[i]! * a[i]!
    exact Array.get_map hi

--------------------------------------------------

This plan implements the cubeElements function and provides a clear, step-by-step proof that our function meets the given specification.
