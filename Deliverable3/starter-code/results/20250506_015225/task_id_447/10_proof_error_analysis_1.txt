Below is a step‐by‐step explanation of what went wrong with the proof, along with recommendations for how to fix it.

1. Identifying the Failing Tactic

The error message reports an “unsolved goals” error when trying to prove

  ∀ i < a.size, (Array.map (fun x => x * x * x) a)[i]! = a[i]! * a[i]! * a[i]!

and then also an “unexpected identifier; expected command” at the point where you write
  intro i hi

The culprit is not that the tactic “intro” itself is conceptually wrong but that Lean isn’t recognizing it as part of the tactic script. In our case the failure comes because of an indentation problem in the tactic block.

2. Considering the Proof State

After you run
  unfold cubeElements cubeElements_spec
and then
  simp [Array.size_map]
the goal reduces to proving the second conjunct:

  ∀ i, i < a.size → (Array.map (fun x => x * x * x) a)[i]! = a[i]! * a[i]! * a[i]!

Your next tactic is

  intro i hi

which is perfectly reasonable if it were inside the proof block. However, because of the mistaken indentation (or stray whitespace), Lean sees this “intro” on a new top-level line rather than as part of the ongoing proof. In the proof state it appears as “unsolved” and causes a parsing error.

3. Checking the Proof Approach

The overall strategy is sound: you unfold the definitions, simplify the size fact using the lemma about mapping over arrays, and then introduce an arbitrary index i (with its bound hi) to prove that the element in the mapped array is the cube of the original element. In terms of logical steps, the approach follows the specification.

4. Identifying Type Mismatches or Incorrect Assumptions

There is no type mismatch—the arrays are of type Array Int (or ℤ) and the arithmetic is as expected. The problem arose not from a wrong equation or an erroneous use of getElem, but because the tactic “intro i hi” was not indented to be recognized as a part of the tactic block. Lean expected a new command at the outer level and found an unexpected identifier.

──────────────────────────────
5. Considering Alternative Proof Strategies

Two possible ways forward are:

• Fix the indentation so that “intro i hi” (and all subsequent tactics) are within the “by” block.
• Alternatively, use a nested proof block (using braces or begin … end) to ensure the structure is clear.

For example, you could rewrite the proof as follows:

  theorem cubeElements_spec_satisfied (a : Array Int) :
   cubeElements_spec a (cubeElements a) := by
   unfold cubeElements cubeElements_spec
   simp [Array.size_map]
   intro i hi
   simp [Array.getElem_map]

Notice that every line inside the “by” block is indented by the same amount.

Conclusion and Root Cause

The root cause of the error is that the line

  intro i hi

was not correctly indented. In Lean 4, tactic proofs use layout-sensitive syntax, so every command inside the “by” block must be indented consistently. Because “intro i hi” was not indented, Lean interpreted it as a new top-level command instead of a tactic within the proof script. This caused Lean to report an “unexpected identifier” error and leave the goal unsolved.

To fix the error, adjust the indentation so that all tactics (including “intro i hi” and “simp [Array.getElem_map]”) are aligned properly inside the proof block.
