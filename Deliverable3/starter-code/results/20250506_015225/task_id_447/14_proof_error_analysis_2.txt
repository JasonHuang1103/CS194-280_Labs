Below is a step‐by‐step analysis of the error in your proof.

─────────────────────────────────────────────  
1. Which tactic is failing and why

The error message tells us that after unfolding the definitions and simplifying, Lean is left with an unsolved goal:

  ∀ i < a.size, (Array.map (fun x => x * x * x) a)[i]! = a[i]! * a[i]! * a[i]!

In your proof you first use:

  unfold cubeElements cubeElements_spec  
  simp [Array.size_map]

This successfully takes care of the first conjunct (showing that the sizes are equal). Next, you introduce i (with “intro i hi”) and then use:

  simp [Array.getElem_map]

However, this tactic call does not completely solve the remaining goal. The simp tactic, even with the lemma for Array.getElem_map, leaves the equality for each element unevaluated. That is why the unsolved goal remains.

─────────────────────────────────────────────  
2. The proof state at that point

At the point after “intro i hi” the goal is:

  ⊢ (Array.map (fun x => x * x * x) a)[i]! = a[i]! * a[i]! * a[i]!

After running “simp [Array.getElem_map]”, Lean still does not have a proof term for the above equality. It remains as an open goal.

─────────────────────────────────────────────  
3. Does the proof approach match the specification?

The specification (cubeElements_spec) requires two things:
 • The sizes of both arrays match.
 • For each index i, the output at position i is the cube of the input at position i.

Your proof correctly begins by handling the size part (with simp and Array.size_map) and then attempts to handle the second part by introducing an arbitrary index i and using simp for Array.getElem_map. However, the strategy does not fully discharge the “for all” part because the rewriting does not yield an outright proof (i.e. a “rfl” or similar) for the equality at hand.

─────────────────────────────────────────────  
4. Any type mismatches or incorrect assumptions?

There is no type mismatch in your code. The error is not coming from mismatched types (both sides of the equality are of type Int) but rather from the fact that the tactics used failed to automatically reduce and prove the equality inside the universal quantifier. In short, the “simp” with Array.getElem_map doesn’t “finish” the goal.

─────────────────────────────────────────────  
5. Consider alternative proof strategies

One way to solve the remaining goal is to “unfold” how Array.getElem_map works or to invoke the corresponding lemma (using “rw” or “simp” with different lemmas, or even “rfl” if the expression is definitionally equal). For instance, you might try something along the lines of:

  theorem cubeElements_spec_satisfied (a : Array Int) :
   cubeElements_spec a (cubeElements a) := by
    unfold cubeElements cubeElements_spec
    simp [Array.size_map]
    intro i hi
    rw [Array.getElem_map]
    rfl

This approach explicitly rewrites using Array.getElem_map and then concludes the equality by reflexivity (“rfl”).

─────────────────────────────────────────────  
Conclusion: Detailed Analysis of the Root Cause and Suggested Fix

The root cause of the error is that after unfolding and simplifying the definitions, the remaining goal 

  ∀ i < a.size, (Array.map (fun x => x * x * x) a)[i]! = a[i]! * a[i]! * a[i]!

is left unsolved because “simp [Array.getElem_map]” does not prove the equality by itself. The “unexpected identifier” error occurs later because there is leftover incomplete proof code expecting further commands.

To fix this error you need to explicitly finish the proof of the universal property. One suggestion is to replace the “simp [Array.getElem_map]” after “intro i hi” with a “rw [Array.getElem_map]” followed by “rfl” (or another tactic that finishes the similarity). That is, complete your proof block by providing a tactic that truly finishes the goal.

By addressing the unsolved remaining goal for every index i, your proof will then completely show that cubeElements_spec is satisfied.
