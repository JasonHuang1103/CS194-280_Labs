Below is a step‐by‐step analysis of the error and its possible cause:

1. Tactic Failing and Why  
 • The error message complains that the tactic “intro” (specifically, Lean’s underlying “introN”) fails because there are “insufficient number of binders.”  
 • In Lean, the tactic intro or introN is used to introduce universally quantified variables or assumptions (i.e. to peel off one or more continuous Pi‑types). When there are no such binders (for example, when the goal is a concrete proposition rather than an implication or a function type), using “intro” triggers an error.

2. The Proof State at That Point  
 • After the line “unfold minOfThree minOfThree_spec”, the goal becomes a statement in the form  
  ((if a ≤ b then if a ≤ c then a else c else …) ≤ a ∧ …) ∧ ((if a ≤ b then …) = a ∨ …),  
  which is already a proposition (a concrete compound logical formula). There is no universal quantification left in the goal that would require binding names; the parameters a, b, and c were introduced in the theorem’s declaration.  
 • Therefore, the “intro” is trying to introduce an extra binder where none exist.

3. Matching the Proof Approach with the Specification  
 • The theorem is meant to prove that the computed result satisfies the specification minOfThree_spec.  
 • After unfolding, the goal is simply a proposition (a conjunction of inequalities and equality conditions) that can be resolved by splitting into cases and applying further tactics such as split, by_cases, exact, or linarith.  
 • There is no need to “intro” anything because no implication or universally quantified variable remains at the top of the goal.

4. Type Mismatches or Incorrect Assumptions  
 • There is no mismatch in types per se (the functions and propositions are all well‑typed).  
 • The primary issue is the incorrect assumption that there is an extra hypothesis or binder to introduce at the start of the proof. The “intro” tactic is mistakenly used here.

5. Alternative Proof Strategies  
 • The simplest fix is to remove the “intro” command. Since the goal is already a concrete proposition, you can start directly by splitting the conjunction (using “split”) and then handling the different parts (possibly via “by_cases” for each branch, as you already attempted).  
 • Alternatively, if you had a goal of the form “P → Q”, then using “intro” would be appropriate; however, here the goal is not an implication.  
 • A restructured proof would begin immediately with “split” to handle the outermost conjunction of the spec.

Conclusion and Root Cause  
 • Root Cause: The error stems from the improper use of “intro” after unfolding the definitions. At that point, the goal does not start with any binders (no universal quantifier or implication remains), so introducing a binder with “intro” is not permitted.  
 • Fixing it: Remove the extraneous “intro” command from the proof. Then, proceed with “split” (and any other tactics) to break apart and prove the parts of the unfolded proposition.

By eliminating “intro” from the proof, you align your tactic usage with the structure of your goal. This change should remove the error and help Lean process the proof correctly.
