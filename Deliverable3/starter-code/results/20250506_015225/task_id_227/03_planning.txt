Below is a complete explanation of our reasoning and a final plan for both the implementation and its proof.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Understanding the Function

• We need a function that takes three integers (a, b, c) and returns the minimum value among them.
• The specification requires two things:
  (1) The returned value (call it result) is less than or equal to each of a, b, and c.
  (2) The result is exactly one of the input numbers.

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Breaking Down the Problem

• One common way to compute the minimum of three numbers is to “chain” comparisons.
  – First, compare a and b; let m = if a ≤ b then a else b.
  – Then, compare m with c; return (if m ≤ c then m else c).
• This approach guarantees that the final value is either a, b, or c and that it is less or equal than each one.

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. Inputs, Edge Cases, and Expected Behavior

• Inputs are integers from which the minimum is always well defined irrespective of sign.
• Edge cases include:
  – All numbers being equal.
  – Two being equal.
  – Some negative numbers.
• Our “if-then-else” strategy works in all these cases since it directly picks one of the inputs.

──────────────────────────────
Step 4. Suitable Proof Techniques

• In the proof, we must show two things:
  (1) The computed minimum is less than or equal to a, b, and c.
  (2) The computed minimum equals a or equals b or equals c.
• Because our definition uses nested conditionals, a proof by cases is natural.
  – We “unfold” the definition and then use "by cases" on the if‑conditions.
• For inequality reasoning, the tactic “linarith” can be used to resolve simple linear inequalities.
• The proof will split into four cases:
  Case 1: a ≤ b and a ≤ c   (result = a).
  Case 2: a ≤ b but not (a ≤ c)  (result = c).
  Case 3: a > b and b ≤ c   (result = b).
  Case 4: a > b and not (b ≤ c)  (result = c).

──────────────────────────────
Step 5. Similar Patterns from Examples

• In the Lean documentation examples, “if-then-else” definitions are often unfolded in proofs.
• Tactics like “cases” to analyze the branches of conditionals and “linarith” for arithmetic reasoning are used.
• The structure here closely mirrors these examples.

Detailed Plan

1. Implementation:
  Define minOfThree using nested if‑then‑else:
   def minOfThree (a : Int) (b : Int) (c : Int) : Int :=
    if a ≤ b then
     if a ≤ c then a else c
    else
     if b ≤ c then b else c

2. Specification:
  We define a predicate minOfThree_spec stating that for a result,
   – result ≤ a ∧ result ≤ b ∧ result ≤ c, and
   – result = a ∨ result = b ∨ result = c.

3. Proof:
  Prove that minOfThree_spec a b c (minOfThree a b c) holds by:
   – Unfolding the definitions of minOfThree and the specification.
   – Using “by cases” on the if‑conditions.
   – In each case, showing that the chosen value (a, b, or c) is indeed ≤ all inputs.
   – Also showing that the returned value is one of a, b, or c.
   – Using tactics like “split” to break conjunctive goals, “cases” to handle conditionals,
    and “linarith” to manage inequalities.

Conclusion

The plan is as follows:
1. Define the function minOfThree using a two-step “if‑then‑else” construction to first get the minimum of a and b, then compare with c.
2. Specify minOfThree_spec, ensuring the result is ≤ a, b, c and equals one of them.
3. Prove minOfThree_spec_satisfied by unfolding the definitions and doing a case analysis on the conditions (a ≤ b and a ≤ c or its negation, etc). Use tactics such as “by_cases”, “split”, and “linarith” (or similar reasoning) to establish the required inequalities.
4. Finally, each branch of the proof concludes by showing that the returned value is one of a, b, or c.

This detailed plan meets the problem’s requirements for both implementation and the accompanying formal proof in Lean 4.
