Below is our detailed reasoning process and final plan.

─────────────────────────────  
Step 1. Understanding the function specification  
• The function must return the smaller (or minimum) of two integers, a and b.  
• When a ≤ b the answer should be a; when a > b the answer will be b.  
• In the equal case, either branch would work, since a = b.

─────────────────────────────  
Step 2. Breaking down the problem  
• The implementation is straightforward: use an if–then–else expression.  
  – Check whether a ≤ b.  
  – If true, return a; otherwise, return b.  
• For the proof we need to show two things for the result (call it r):  
  1. r ≤ a and r ≤ b.  
  2. r is either exactly a or exactly b.

─────────────────────────────  
Step 3. Considering inputs, edge cases, and expected behavior  
• Inputs are integers (Int) which are totally ordered.  
• Edge cases include when a = b; our implementation returns a (or b) and the proof holds since a = b.  
• There is no risk of division by zero or other exceptional cases.

─────────────────────────────  
Step 4. Choosing the appropriate proof strategy  
• We start the proof by unfolding the definitions of myMin and myMin_spec.  
• Since our definition is by an if–then–else, we can use the tactic split_ifs (or cases on the condition) to consider the two cases:  
  Case 1: When a ≤ b holds.  
   – Then, by definition, myMin a b is a, so trivially a ≤ a (by reflexivity) and we already assumed a ≤ b.  
   – Also, the result is exactly a, so the “either a or b” condition holds via “or.inl rfl”.  
  Case 2: When a ≤ b does not hold (i.e. ¬ (a ≤ b))  
   – Then myMin a b is b.  
   – In this branch, we use the properties of integers: if a ≤ b is false then b < a, so in particular b ≤ a holds.  
   – And obviously b ≤ b by reflexivity.  
   – The result equals b, so the “or” condition is satisfied via “or.inr rfl”.

─────────────────────────────  
Step 5. Referencing similar proof patterns  
• The examples in the Lean documentation show the use of tactics like unfold, split_ifs, split, and exact.  
• We see that bullet notation or the split_ifs tactic efficiently handles the two branches from an if–then–else statement.

Final Detailed Plan  

A. Implementation  
 Define myMin by comparing a and b:  
  def myMin (a : Int) (b : Int) : Int :=  
   if a ≤ b then a else b

B. Specification  
 Define myMin_spec so that it requires:
  (1) result ≤ a and result ≤ b  
  (2) result is either equal to a or equal to b

C. Proof of the theorem myMin_spec_satisfied  
 1. Unfold the definitions for myMin and myMin_spec.  
 2. Use the tactic split_ifs to split the proof into the two cases.  
  Case1: When a ≤ b  
   – Conclude that the result is a. Prove that a ≤ a (by reflexivity) and a ≤ b (by the hypothesis).  
   – Conclude that the result equals a (so a = a ∨ a = b holds via left disjunct).  
  Case2: When ¬ (a ≤ b)  
   – Conclude that the result is b. Prove that b ≤ a (since not a ≤ b implies b < a, hence b ≤ a) and b ≤ b (reflexivity).  
   – Conclude that result equals b (i.e. a = b ∨ b = b holds via right disjunct).

------------------------------------------------

This plan yields a complete Lean 4 solution where the implementation of myMin is defined using an if–then–else and the proof verifies that the output is less than or equal to each input and is either exactly a or exactly b.
