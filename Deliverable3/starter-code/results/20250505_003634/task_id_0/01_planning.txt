Below is a detailed plan outlining the steps to solve the problem.

─────────────────────────────

1. Implementation of the Function:
   • The function is called ident and it takes a natural number x.
   • Since the specification requires returning “the same natural number as input,” the function simply has to return x.
   • In Lean code, this means replacing the placeholder with x. That is,
     
     def ident (x : Nat) : Nat := x

2. Defining the Specification:
   • The specification ident_spec states that the result of calling ident on x should be equal to x.
   • This is written as a proposition: result = x.

3. Theorem for the Specification:
   • The theorem ident_spec_satisfied needs to prove that the ident function meets its specification.
   • You will have to show that, for every natural number x, ident_spec x (ident x) holds.
   • After unfolding ident and ident_spec in the proof, you will get the goal
     
     ident x = x
     
     which becomes x = x.

4. Proving the Theorem:
   • The equality x = x is trivial (since it is true by reflexivity).
   • In Lean, the tactic rfl (reflexivity) proves that any term equals itself.
   • So the main proof step will simply invoke rfl.

5. Summary of Key Points:
   • Replace the placeholder in the ident implementation with the identity operation: x.
   • Understand that ident_spec requires that the returned value equals the input.
   • In the proof, simply unfold the definitions so that the goal reduces to x = x.
   • Apply rfl (or any equivalent tactic) to close the proof.

Following these steps, your final Lean code would look like this:

------------------------------------------------------------
import Mathlib
import Aesop

-- Implementation
def ident (x : Nat) : Nat :=
  -- << CODE START >>
  x
  -- << CODE END >>

def ident_spec (x : Nat) (result: Nat) : Prop :=
  -- << SPEC START >>
  result = x
  -- << SPEC END >>

theorem ident_spec_satisfied (x : Nat) :
  ident_spec x (ident x) := by
  -- << PROOF START >>
  unfold ident ident_spec
  rfl
  -- << PROOF END >>
------------------------------------------------------------

This plan and the outlined steps ensure that the identity function is correctly implemented and its correctness is proven using reflexivity.
