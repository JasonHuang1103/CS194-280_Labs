Below is a high‐level plan that explains both the implementation and the proof strategy.

──────────────────────────────────────────────
Step 1. Implementation

• Use Lean’s built‑in integer minimum function. In Lean, given two integers x and y, one can use (x.min y) (or an if–then–else) to return the smaller of the two.  
• Thus, to return the minimum among three integers a, b, and c, we can define:
  minOfThree a b c = a.min (b.min c)  
This works because:
  – b.min c is by definition ≤ b and ≤ c, and equals one of these two.
  – Then a.min (b.min c) is ≤ a and ≤ (b.min c), which means it is ≤ b and ≤ c.
  – The final answer is either a or (b.min c) where (b.min c) equals b or c.

──────────────────────────────────────────────
Step 2. Writing the Spec

The specification is given by minOfThree_spec stating two requirements:
  1. The result is less than or equal to each of a, b, c.
  2. The result is exactly one of a, b, or c.

──────────────────────────────────────────────
Step 3. Plan for the Proof

To prove that minOfThree_spec_satisfied holds, we proceed as follows:

1. Unfold the definitions of minOfThree and minOfThree_spec. This brings out the definition “minOfThree a b c = a.min (b.min c)”.
2. Prove that (a.min (b.min c)) ≤ a by invoking a standard lemma such as Int.min_le_left.
3. Prove that (a.min (b.min c)) is ≤ (b.min c) by using Int.min_le_right.  
   Then, using properties of min applied to b and c, show that (b.min c) ≤ b and (b.min c) ≤ c.
4. For the “one of” part, proceed by cases:
  a. Case 1: Assume a is less than or equal to (b.min c). Then a.min (b.min c) equals a. From that it follows: result = a.
  b. Case 2: Otherwise, a > (b.min c), so a.min (b.min c) equals (b.min c). Now, by definition of min on two numbers we know:
   – Either b ≤ c, so b.min c = b, or  
   – c ≤ b, so b.min c = c.
  In either subcase, result equals either b or c.
5. Conclude that in all cases the result is one of a, b, or c, and it is less than or equal to all the inputs.

──────────────────────────────────────────────
Step 4. Coding the Proof

You might write the proof in Lean using tactical proofs (by cases or by straightforward application of known lemmas). The key Lean tactics you will likely use include:
  – unfold
  – apply or exact
  – by_cases (or cases on conditions like a ≤ (b.min c) and b ≤ c)
  – and_then use lemmas like Int.min_le_left and Int.min_le_right.

──────────────────────────────────────────────
Step 5. Summary

• Define minOfThree using the built‑in min operation.  
• In the theorem proof, use the properties of the min operation to show the result is less than or equal to each input and equals one of them.  
• The case analysis (first on a vs. b.min c, then, if needed, on b vs. c) completes the second part of the spec.

By following these steps you can structure both the function’s code and its correctness proof. This plan should help in writing a Lean 4 module that meets the assignment’s requirements.
