The error occurs because Lean doesn't have a built-in method field "min" for Int. In other words, you cannot write a.min (b.min c) because the min method isn't defined for â„¤. One common fix is to define the minimum using if-then-else expressions. Here's a corrected version of the implementation:

-------------------------------------------------
def minOfThree (a : Int) (b : Int) (c : Int) : Int :=
  let minAB := if a <= b then a else b
  if minAB <= c then minAB else c
-------------------------------------------------

This version computes the minimum of a and b, then compares it with c, thereby returning the minimum among the three integers.
