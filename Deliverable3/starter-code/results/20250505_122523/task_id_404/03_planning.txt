Below is a detailed plan for solving the problem, including both the Lean implementation of the myMin function and the corresponding proof showing that it meets the specification.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Implementation of myMin

• We need a function myMin : Int → Int → Int that returns the smaller of two integers.
• A straightforward way is to use an if-then-else construct:
  - If a ≤ b then the minimum is a.
  - Otherwise, the minimum is b.
• In Lean 4 we can write:
  if a ≤ b then a else b

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Stating the Specification

• The property myMin_spec requires two conditions:
  1. The computed result is less than or equal to each input (i.e. result ≤ a and result ≤ b).
  2. The result equals either a or b (i.e. result = a ∨ result = b).
• We state this as a predicate on a, b, and the result.

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. Proving the Specification

The theorem myMin_spec_satisfied should show that myMin_spec a b (myMin a b) holds for all a, b.

Plan for the proof:
1. Unfold the definitions of myMin and myMin_spec so that we can see the if-then-else definition and the specification.
2. Perform a case split on the condition (a ≤ b) used in the if construct:
  a) Case when a ≤ b:
   • Then myMin a b reduces to a.
   • Show that a is less than or equal to itself, and also a ≤ b because we assumed it.
   • Also, note that a = a, which satisfies the second part of the specification.
  b) Case when ¬ (a ≤ b) (i.e. a > b):
   • Then myMin a b reduces to b.
   • Show that b is less than or equal to itself, and since a > b, we can deduce b ≤ a is true.
   • Also, b = b, satisfying the required equality condition.
3. Combine the results of the two cases with the tactic split.

Step 4. Writing the Code and Proof

The Lean code would be structured as follows:

-------------------------
import Mathlib
import Aesop

-- Implementation
def myMin (a : Int) (b : Int) : Int :=
  if a ≤ b then a else b

-- Specification: The result is less than or equal to both a and b; and it equals one of them.
def myMin_spec (a : Int) (b : Int) (result : Int) : Prop :=
  (result ≤ a ∧ result ≤ b) ∧
  (result = a ∨ result = b)

theorem myMin_spec_satisfied (a : Int) (b : Int) :
  myMin_spec a b (myMin a b) := by
  unfold myMin myMin_spec
  split
  · -- Prove that the result is less than or equal to a and b
    split
    · -- Case: when a ≤ b (result = a) ; when ¬ (a ≤ b) (result = b)
      by_cases h : a ≤ b
      · -- In the case a ≤ b, result = a, so a ≤ a and, by assumption, a ≤ b.
        simp [if_pos h]
        exact ⟨le_refl a, h⟩
      · -- In the case ¬ (a ≤ b): then result = b and b ≤ b and b ≤ a since a > b.
        simp [if_neg h]
        exact ⟨(le_of_lt (Int.lt_of_not_ge h)), le_refl b⟩
  · -- Prove that result equals either a or b
    by_cases h : a ≤ b
    · simp [if_pos h]; left; rfl
    · simp [if_neg h]; right; rfl

-------------------------

Summary of Key Steps

1. Use the if-then-else structure in Lean to implement the function.
2. Clearly state the specification requiring the result to be less than or equal to both inputs and equal to one of them.
3. In the theorem proof:
  • Unfold the definitions to work with the actual implementation.
  • Perform a case split on the condition used in the if statement.
  • For each case, prove that both parts of the specification hold.
4. Combine the results to finish the proof.

This plan covers the essentials for both the implementation and the correctness proof of the minimum function in Lean 4.
