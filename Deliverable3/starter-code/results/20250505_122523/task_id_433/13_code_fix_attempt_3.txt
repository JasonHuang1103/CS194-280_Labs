The error is caused by how Lean parses the lambda argument when itâ€™s not explicitly parenthesized. In your code the lambda is written without its own set of parentheses:
  
  (a.toList).all fun x => decide (n > x)

Lean ends up trying to interpret (a.toList).all fun x as a single function, and then applying it to decide (n > x), which is just a Bool. To fix the error you should add parentheses around the lambda function, like so:

------------------------------------------------
def isGreater (n : Int) (a : Array Int) : Bool :=
  (a.toList).all (fun x => decide (n > x))
------------------------------------------------

This tells Lean that the argument to .all is the entire lambda (fun x => decide (n > x)), and then it works as intended.
