We can break down the problem into two main parts:

1. Implementation of the isGreater function.
2. Proving that the function meets the given specification (isGreater_spec).

Below is a detailed plan explaining the key steps and ideas for each part.

───────────────────────────── 
Step 1. Implementation

• The function isGreater takes an integer n and an array of integers a. The goal is to return true if for every element x in a the inequality n > x holds and false otherwise.

• Lean’s Array library provides tools for iterating over arrays. One common strategy is to use a built‐in higher-order function that “tests” a predicate for every element in the array. For example, one can use a function like all? (or an equivalent construct) which checks whether the predicate holds for all elements.

• Hence, you can implement isGreater simply as:
  isGreater n a = a.all? (fun x ↦ n > x)

 This is concise and exactly captures the specification:
  “Return true if ∀ x ∈ a, n > x; otherwise false.”

───────────────────────────── 
Step 2. Theorem and Proof

The theorem isGreater_spec states:
  “(∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!) ↔ result”
when result = isGreater n a.

Here’s how you might plan the proof:

• Unfold the definitions for isGreater and isGreater_spec. After unfolding, the goal is to prove:

  (∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!) ↔ a.all? (fun x ↦ n > x)

• One key observation is that the predicate (∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!) is equivalent to saying “for every element of a (accessed via array’s indexing), the predicate n > x holds”. 

• If Lean’s mathlib (or Lean’s Array module) provides a lemma stating that “a.all? p ↔ (∀ i, i < a.size → p (a[i]!))”, then you can simply apply that lemma. (Often such a lemma is named something similar to Array.all?_iff_forall.)

• If such a lemma is not directly available, you can prove the equivalence by induction on a, or by reasoning via the definition of all? (which is usually defined using a recursive helper that traverses the array).

• Thus the proof will be mostly by unfolding the definitions and applying (or proving) the equivalence between all? and the forall-version of the predicate.

Summary of the Detailed Plan

1. Write the function:
  def isGreater (n : Int) (a : Array Int) : Bool :=
   a.all? (fun x ↦ n > x)

2. State the specification:
  def isGreater_spec (n : Int) (a : Array Int) (result : Bool) : Prop :=
   (∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!) ↔ result

3. Prove the theorem:
  theorem isGreater_spec_satisfied (n : Int) (a : Array Int) :
   isGreater_spec n a (isGreater n a) := by
   unfold isGreater isGreater_spec
   /– Now, either apply a lemma such as Array.all?_iff_forall if available,
    or prove the equivalence by induction on the array’s structure. –/
   … (details)

This plan provides a clear path:
 • Use the array’s built‐in all? function for a short and faithful implementation.
 • Unfold the specifications and prove that the boolean produced by the function corresponds exactly to the logical condition that n is greater than all array elements.

Using this plan, you can now implement the code and fill in the proof details accordingly.
