Below is the detailed step-by-step reasoning followed by the final plan for the Lean 4 implementation and proof.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Understanding the Function Specification

• The function ident should take a natural number, x : Nat, and return a natural number that is exactly equal to x.
• Therefore, the behavior is simply the identity function on the natural numbers.

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Breaking Down the Problem

• Implementation Subproblem:
  - We need to write the function body in ident such that for any input x, it returns x.
  - The simplest solution is to write "x" as the definition.

• Proof Subproblem:
  - We have a specification ident_spec which states that the result is equal to x; that is, result = x.
  - The theorem ident_spec_satisfied must show that ident_spec x (ident x) holds.
  - By unfolding the definitions, we will be left with showing x = x, which is true by reflexivity.

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. Consider Input Types and Edge Cases

• The input is of type Nat. Since the identity function does not need to handle exceptional behavior or edge cases (e.g., negative numbers do not apply because they are not in Nat), the solution remains valid for every natural number.

──────────────────────────────
Step 4. Choosing Appropriate Proof Techniques

• To show x = x after unfolding, we can simply use the reflexivity property of equality (tactic: rfl).
• This is the standard technique in Lean to simplify direct equalities.

──────────────────────────────
Step 5. Utilizing Similar Patterns or Examples

• Many examples in Lean for an identity function or simple equality proof use "rfl" for these direct cases.
• Also, as seen in examples from Lean documentation, unfolding definitions and then applying reflexivity is a common proof pattern.

──────────────────────────────
Detailed Final Plan

• Implementation:
  - Define ident by simply returning x.
• Proof:
  - Unfold definitions of both ident and ident_spec.
  - Use the reflexivity tactic (rfl) to conclude the theorem.

Final Lean 4 Code with Implementation and Proof

Below is the complete Lean 4 solution based on our plan:

-------------------------------------------------
import Mathlib
import Aesop

-- Implementation
def ident (x : Nat) : Nat :=
  -- << CODE START >>
  x
  -- << CODE END >>

def ident_spec (x : Nat) (result: Nat) : Prop :=
  -- << SPEC START >>
  result = x
  -- << SPEC END >>

theorem ident_spec_satisfied (x : Nat) :
  ident_spec x (ident x) := by
  -- << PROOF START >>
  unfold ident ident_spec
  rfl
  -- << PROOF END >>
-------------------------------------------------

This completes the solution: the function ident correctly implements the identity function on Nat, and the theorem ident_spec_satisfied is proved with a simple reflexivity step, as required.
