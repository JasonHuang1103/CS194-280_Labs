Reinforcement learning can be used to solve tasks such as decision making and knowledge discovery. This is due to the exploration exploitation paradigm.
One of the most common methods in aMachine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms capable of learning from and making decisions based on data. These algorithms identify patterns within data, enabling systems to improve their performance over time without explicit programming. Applications of machine learning span various domains, including image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics, making it a cornerstone of modern technological advancements.
The attention mechanism is a crucial innovation in deep learning, especially in natural language processing (NLP). It allows models to focus on specific parts of the input data while ignoring irrelevant information. For example, in machine translation, attention helps the model focus on the relevant words of the source sentence when generating a translation. The self-attention mechanism, popularized by models like Transformers, has made it possible to process sequences in parallel, drastically improving performance over earlier models like RNNs.
