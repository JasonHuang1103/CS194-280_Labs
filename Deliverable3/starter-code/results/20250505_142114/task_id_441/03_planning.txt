Below is our step-by-step reasoning and plan for the implementation and proof.

-----------------------------------------
Step 1. Understand the Function Specification

• The function cubeSurfaceArea takes an integer size that represents the length of an edge of a cube.  
• Using the formula for the surface area of a cube, we need to compute  
  surface_area = 6 * (size * size)  
• Thus, the function should return 6 * size * size.

-----------------------------------------
Step 2. Break Down the Problem into Subproblems

• Write the Lean function cubeSurfaceArea that computes 6 * size * size.  
• Define the specification cubeSurfaceArea_spec which states that the result must equal 6 * size * size.  
• Prove in theorem cubeSurfaceArea_spec_satisfied that if we compute cubeSurfaceArea size, it indeed meets our specification.

-----------------------------------------
Step 3. Consider Input Types, Edge Cases, and Expected Behavior

• Input Type: The input size is an Int.  
• Precondition: Although the problem assumes size > 0, our function simply computes an arithmetic expression. We do not add extra checks here, but note that negative sizes would lead to a result that mathematically follows 6 * size * size, even if a negative edge length is not physically meaningful.  
• Expected Behavior: For a given positive integer size, the function returns an integer that is the surface area.

-----------------------------------------
Step 4. Appropriate Proof Techniques

• Since our function is defined using a straightforward arithmetic computation, we can prove its correctness by unfolding the definitions and applying reflexivity (rfl) to show both sides of the equality are the same.  
• The proof tactic “rfl” will suffice after unfolding definitions because Lean will see that both sides are identical.

-----------------------------------------
Step 5. Patterns from Examples

• The Lean documentation examples often rely on unfolding definitions and using the reflexivity tactic in trivial arithmetic proofs.  
• Our task is similar to those straightforward examples where the implementation is a direct computation and the proof is a simple verification of equality.

-----------------------------------------
Detailed Plan for Implementation and Proof

1. Implementation:
  • In the definition of cubeSurfaceArea, replace {{code}} with 6 * size * size.

2. Proof:
  • In the theorem cubeSurfaceArea_spec_satisfied, unfold the definitions of cubeSurfaceArea and cubeSurfaceArea_spec.  
  • Use the tactic rfl to conclude the proof since both sides simplify to 6 * size * size.

-----------------------------------------
Below is the complete Lean 4 code following our plan:

-------------------------------------------------
import Mathlib
import Aesop

-- Implementation
def cubeSurfaceArea (size : Int) : Int :=
  -- << CODE START >>
  6 * size * size
  -- << CODE END >>

-- Theorem: The surface area of the cube is calculated correctly
def cubeSurfaceArea_spec (size : Int) (result : Int) : Prop :=
  -- << SPEC START >>
  result = 6 * size * size
  -- << SPEC END >>

theorem cubeSurfaceArea_spec_satisfied (size : Int):
  cubeSurfaceArea_spec size (cubeSurfaceArea size) := by
  -- << PROOF START >>
  unfold cubeSurfaceArea cubeSurfaceArea_spec
  rfl
  -- << PROOF END >>
-------------------------------------------------

This completes our implementation and the proof that the surface area is computed correctly as 6 * size * size.
