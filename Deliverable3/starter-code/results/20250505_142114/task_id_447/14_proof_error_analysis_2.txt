Below is a step‐by‐step analysis of the problem and what’s causing Lean to complain:

────────────────────────────────────────
1. Tactic Failure – Which Tactic Is Failing and Why:

• The proof begins with
  unfold cubeElements cubeElements_spec
  apply And.intro
 When you execute “apply And.intro”, Lean splits the goal into two subgoals – one for each conjunct in the specification.

• The next lines are meant to solve those subgoals using the bullet notation “·”. However, an error is thrown: “unexpected token '·'; expected command”. This means that Lean is not recognizing your bullet lines as tactics attached to subgoals.

────────────────────────────────────────
2. The Proof State at That Point:

• After “apply And.intro”, the proof state becomes:
  Goal 1: (Array.map (fun x => x*x*x) a).size = a.size
  Goal 2: ∀ i, i < a.size → (Array.map (fun x => x*x*x) a)[i]! = a[i]! * a[i]! * a[i]!
• The intended next two tactics (one per subgoal) are written using “· …”, but Lean complains before even processing them. In addition, because it does not recognize those tokens, both subgoals remain unsolved.

────────────────────────────────────────
3. Matching the Proof Approach to the Specification:

• Your overall strategy is correct: you “unfold” the definitions, apply the conjunction intro to split the goal, and then plan to invoke known lemmas (Array.size_map and Array.getElem_map) to solve the two subgoals.
• The approach is valid; it only “breaks” because the bullets are not being parsed as part of the tactic script.

────────────────────────────────────────
4. Type Mismatches or Incorrect Assumptions:

• There is no inherent type mismatch in the use of Array.size_map or Array.getElem_map. These lemmas are expected to give the desired equalities.
• The error, “unexpected token '·'”, indicates that the syntax is not acceptable where it appears. This is typically an indentation or bullet formatting issue, not a type error.

────────────────────────────────────────
5. Alternative Proof Strategies and What's Going Wrong:

• In Lean 4, bullet notation (using “·”) is supported, but it must be correctly indented so that Lean sees them as tactics for the subgoals. The error suggests that the “·” tokens are at the wrong indentation level or simply causing a parse error.
  For example, notice that after “apply And.intro” the bullet lines must continue at a deeper indentation – if they are “flush left” or not aligned with the opened block, Lean might not treat them as part of the interactive proof, causing the “unsolved goals” error.
• An alternative is to avoid bullets altogether and write separate tactic commands for each subgoal – or ensure your bullets are correctly indented as follows:

────────────────────────────────────────
Suggested Fix – Correcting the Bullet Indentations:

One way to fix it is to write the proof like this:

  theorem cubeElements_spec_satisfied (a : Array Int) :
   cubeElements_spec a (cubeElements a) := by
     unfold cubeElements cubeElements_spec
     apply And.intro
       · exact Array.size_map a (fun x => x * x * x)
       · intro i hi; exact Array.getElem_map a (fun x => x * x * x) i

Make sure the bullet lines (the ones starting with “·”) are indented more deeply than the “apply And.intro” line. In Lean 4 the indentation is significant, and an unexpected bullet token means they are not aligned where they’re expected.

────────────────────────────────────────
Root Cause and Direction for Fixing:

The root cause of your error is that after splitting the goal with “apply And.intro”, the bullet tactics are mis-indented (or unexpectedly placed) so that Lean does not treat them as commands to solve the generated subgoals. Thus, the proof never closes its goals, and Lean reports “unsolved goals” alongside an “unexpected token '·'” error.

To fix this, adjust the indentation so that each bullet (·) is nested within the proof block opened by “apply And.intro”. Alternatively, you could avoid bullets and use separate tactic lines with explicit commands. Once fixed, Lean will properly parse your tactic script and apply the lemmas to close both subgoals.

This adjustment should resolve both the “unsolved goals” and the “unexpected token” error.
