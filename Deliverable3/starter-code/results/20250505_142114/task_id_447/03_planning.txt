Below is a detailed explanation of our reasoning plus a plan for the implementation and proof.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Understanding the function’s behavior

• The function cubeElements takes an Array Int as input and returns an Array Int.
• For each element x in the array, the output must compute the cube, which is x * x * x.
• In Lean’s Array library, a common approach is to use the built‐in map function. That is, we can map the transformation (λ x, x * x * x) over the array.

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Breaking down the problem

Our task divides into two parts:

A. Implementation:
   • Write cubeElements so that it returns a.map (λ x, x * x * x).
   • This guarantees that every element in a is replaced by its cube.

B. Proof:
   • Prove that the returned array has the same size as the input.
   • Prove that for any valid index i, result[i]! equals a[i]! * a[i]! * a[i]!.
   • We will use the properties of Array.map:
       - Array.map preserves the size of the array.
       - The mapping lemma: For any i, if i < a.size, then (a.map f)[i]! = f (a[i]!).

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. Considering input types, edge cases, and expected behavior

• Input type: Array Int.
• Edge cases:
   - Empty array: For an empty array, mapping over it should return an empty array.
   - Single-element or negative integers: The cube of any integer is computed using multiplication.
• Expected behavior: The transformation and mapping does not change the index positions or size.

──────────────────────────────
Step 4. Proof techniques

Our overall proof will be by unfolding the definitions.
• We use properties about Array.map:
  - A lemma that shows (a.map f).size = a.size.
  - A lemma that shows for all indices i, if i < a.size, then (a.map f)[i]! = f (a[i]!).
• We may either reference these classic lemmas directly (if available) or simply perform a case analysis with the unfolding of definitions.
• Our proof will use introduction of index i, and then apply the mapping property.

──────────────────────────────
Step 5. Recognizing similar patterns

In many examples with arrays in Lean, mapping an operation on an array and then proving properties about the result is a standard pattern. In our case:
• The transformation using Array.map is a very commonly used method in Lean 4.
• The proof can be completed by “unfolding” the definitions and then applying the library lemmas or simply reasoning by the definition of Array.map.

──────────────────────────────
Detailed Plan

1. Implementation:
   • Define cubeElements so that it uses a.map (λ x, x * x * x).
   • This ensures that every element in the input array a is replaced by its cube.

2. Specification:
   • Our cubeElements_spec predicate states that:
       - The result’s size is equal to the input array’s size.
       - For every valid index i, result[i]! equals a[i]! cubed.

3. Proof of cubeElements_spec_satisfied:
   • Unfold cubeElements to expose the map.
   • Use the fact that Array.map preserves the size of the array.
   • For the second part of the spec, introduce any index i with i < a.size.
   • Use the property of Array.map that (a.map f)[i]! = f (a[i]!) to conclude the cube property.
   • If Lean’s library has a lemma (for example, Array.get_map or Array.map_nth) that gives this, we can simply apply it, otherwise the proof will involve a simple rewriting.
   • Complete the proof by applying these facts.

Final Implementation and Proof (Template answer)

Below is an example of what our Lean solution would look like:

---------------------------------------------------------------
import Mathlib
import Aesop

-- Implementation
def cubeElements (a : Array Int) : Array Int :=
  -- << CODE START >>
  a.map (fun x => x * x * x)
  -- << CODE END >>

-- Theorem: The length of the output array must be the same as the length of the input array;
-- Each element in the output array is the cube of the corresponding element in the input array
def cubeElements_spec (a : Array Int) (result : Array Int) : Prop :=
  -- << SPEC START >>
  (result.size = a.size) ∧
  (∀ i, i < a.size → result[i]! = a[i]! * a[i]! * a[i]!)
  -- << SPEC END >>

theorem cubeElements_spec_satisfied (a : Array Int) :
  cubeElements_spec a (cubeElements a) := by
  -- << PROOF START >>
  unfold cubeElements cubeElements_spec
  constructor
  · -- Prove the sizes are equal
    -- Array.map preserves the size.
    exact Array.map_size _
  · -- Prove each element is cubed.
    intro i hi
    -- Using the property that for mapping: (a.map f)[i]! = f (a[i]!).
    simp [Array.get_map]  -- assuming Array.get_map is available; otherwise use the corresponding lemma.
  -- << PROOF END >>

---------------------------------------------------------------

Explanation of the proof steps:
• The first part uses Array.map_size to conclude that the size of a.map f is the same as a.size.
• The second part, for an arbitrary index i satisfying i < a.size, uses a known property of Array.map (here referenced as Array.get_map) to relate (a.map (fun x => x * x * x))[i]! with a[i]! and then concludes it equals a[i]! * a[i]! * a[i]! by definition.

Conclusion

We have now:
1. Understood the requirements.
2. Identified the use of Array.map for both the implementation and validity properties.
3. Listed the edge cases and input types.
4. Outlined a proof strategy using standard mapping properties (size preservation and index equality).
5. Provided a detailed plan and a complete Lean code snippet incorporating the implementation and proof.

This approach satisfies both the function specification and the associated correctness theorem.
