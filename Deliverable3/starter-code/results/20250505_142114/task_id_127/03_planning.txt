Below is our detailed reasoning and plan for both the implementation and the proof.

─────────────────────────────  
Step 1: Understand the Function Specification  
• The function multiply should compute the product of two integers.  
• In Lean 4, the multiplication of integers is available via the built-in operator (*).  
• Thus, the implementation almost directly uses a * b.

─────────────────────────────  
Step 2: Break Down the Problem  
• Implementation subproblem:  
  – Define a function multiply that accepts two Int arguments and returns a * b.  
• Proof subproblem:  
  – We must prove that the function's result (multiply a b) indeed equals a * b, according to the specification (multiply_spec).

─────────────────────────────  
Step 3: Consider Input Types, Edge Cases, and Behavior  
• The inputs a and b are of type Int, which naturally supports negative values, zero, and positive values.  
• No additional edge case handling is needed because the built-in multiplication operator works for all integers.  
• The specification is simple and relies on the fact that Lean’s multiplication operator is correctly defined.

─────────────────────────────  
Step 4: Proof Techniques  
• To prove multiply_spec_satisfied, note that by our definition, multiply a b is a * b.  
• Unfolding both multiply and multiply_spec reveals the same equality: a * b = a * b.  
• This equality is reflexively true, so the rfl (short for “reflexivity”) tactic suffices.

─────────────────────────────  
Step 5: Note Similar Patterns  
• As seen in Lean documentation and examples, when a function is defined using a built-in operator and the property reflects that exact computation, the proof is by definition unfolding and then using rfl.  
• This pattern is frequently used when verifying simple arithmetic definitions in Lean.

Detailed Plan for Implementation and Proof

1. Implementation:  
   • Create the definition of multiply by returning a * b.  
   • This directly uses Lean's arithmetic on integers.

2. Specification:  
   • The predicate multiply_spec asserts that the result equals a * b.

3. Proof:  
   • In multiply_spec_satisfied, unfold the definitions so that the theorem reduces to the trivial equality a * b = a * b.
   • Use rfl to conclude the proof.

─────────────────────────────  
Below is the complete Lean 4 code that follows this plan:

------------------------------------------------------------
import Mathlib
import Aesop

-- Implementation
def multiply (a : Int) (b : Int) : Int :=
  -- << CODE START >>
  a * b
  -- << CODE END >>

-- Theorem: The result should be the product of the two input integers
def multiply_spec (a : Int) (b : Int) (result : Int) : Prop :=
  -- << SPEC START >>
  result = a * b
  -- << SPEC END >>

theorem multiply_spec_satisfied (a : Int) (b : Int) :
  multiply_spec a b (multiply a b) := by
  -- << PROOF START >>
  -- Unfold the definitions of multiply and multiply_spec,
  -- then conclude by reflexivity since a * b = a * b.
  unfold multiply multiply_spec
  rfl
  -- << PROOF END >>
------------------------------------------------------------

─────────────────────────────  
Conclusion  
• The multiply function is defined to compute a * b.  
• The proof multiplies both sides in the unfolded goal, where both are definitionally equal, and the proof is completed with rfl.  
• This approach directly satisfies the problem description and specification.
