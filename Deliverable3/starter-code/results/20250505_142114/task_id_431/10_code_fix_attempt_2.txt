We’re getting errors pointing at the lambda expression. In our case the error messages

  • “missing end of character literal”  
  • “unexpected token '.'; expected ':'”

indicate that the lambda was originally written using a period instead of using Lean 4’s required arrow syntax. In other words, the original code was written like

  a.any (λ x. b.contains x)

so that the parser interpreted the “.” after x as starting a character literal (and then not finding its end) instead of being the separator between the parameter and body.

Let’s walk through the analysis step by step:

1. Identify the specific part of the code causing the error  
  The lambda expression in the definition of hasCommonElement is at fault. In the original code it must have been written as  
    a.any (λ x. b.contains x)  
  and the period “.” is flagged by the parser.

2. Explain why this is causing an issue  
  In Lean 4 the syntax for lambda expressions changed: instead of writing “λ x. …” now you need to write “λ x => …” (or equivalently, “fun x => …”). The parser sees the period “.” after x and mistakenly treats it as the beginning of a character literal that isn’t closed.

3. Consider the type system and Lean 4 requirements  
  The expected type for a.any is (Int → Bool), and using the proper lambda syntax “λ x => …” provides a valid function of that type. The misuse of the period disrupts the parsing of the lambda and causes the reported errors.

4. Think through potential solutions  
  We just need to update the lambda so that it uses the “=>” arrow. That is, we delete the “.” and replace it with “=>”. (Alternatively, we could write “fun x => …”.)

5. Test each solution in your head  
  If we write  
    a.any (λ x => b.contains x)  
  or  
    a.any (fun x => b.contains x)  
  Lean 4 is happy with the lambda-defining syntax. This will compile correctly.

Thus, the fixed version of the function implementation is as follows:

-------------------------------------------------
def hasCommonElement (a : Array Int) (b : Array Int) : Bool :=
  a.any (λ x => b.contains x)
-------------------------------------------------

This change satisfies Lean 4’s lambda expression syntax requirements and resolves the errors.
