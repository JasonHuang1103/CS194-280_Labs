Below is a step‐by‐step explanation of what’s going wrong.

────────────────────────────
1. Tactic Failure: Using simp with Nonexistent Lemmas

In your proof you write

  simp [Array.any_eq_true, Array.contains_eq_true]

Lean complains that it “unknown constant ‘Array.contains_eq_true’.” That is, the simp call is trying to use two rewrite rules, but the second one (and possibly the first as well) is not defined in the libraries you imported. Mathlib’s Array module does not provide a lemma named Array.contains_eq_true so Lean cannot simplify the goal using it.

────────────────────────────
2. The Proof State and the Mismatch

After you call “unfold hasCommonElement hasCommonElement_spec” and then “simp [Array.any_eq_true, Array.contains_eq_true]”, the goal is transformed into a statement of the form

   (∃ i j, i < a.size ∧ j < b.size ∧ a[i]! = b[j]!) ↔ (…some Boolean expression…)

But what actually appears on the right side is not exactly what you intend. In your proof the “spec” is that there is a common element (given by two indices with the equality) if and only if the Boolean result is true. However, because of the missing or misnamed lemmas, the simplification does not convert between the Boolean computations (the definitions for Array.any and Array.contains) and the existential quantifiers as expected. (For instance, the proof state complains that one side is now expressed as “∃ i, ∃ (h : i < a.size), a[i] ∈ b” instead of matching your spec.)

────────────────────────────
3. Does the Proof Approach Match the Specification?

Your overall idea is correct: you want to show

    a.any (λ x => b.contains x) 
  ↔ (∃ i j, i < a.size ∧ j < b.size ∧ a[i]! = b[j]!).

The intended approach was to use known equivalences about how “any” and “contains” are defined. However, because you referred to lemmas by incorrect names (or names that aren’t provided by Mathlib), your proof does not bridge that gap. Additionally, if you meant to use “Array.exists_index_of_mem” to translate membership into an existential about indices, you must ensure that lemma exists and is used consistently with the resulting goal type.

────────────────────────────
4. Type Mismatches and Incorrect Assumptions

There is a subtle mismatch: the specification uses the notation

    a[i]! = b[j]!

which is the way to dereference elements, but then in the error message Lean shows a goal with a statement like “a[i] ∈ b”. That means somewhere the definitions you are using are being “simplified” into an expression about membership rather than equality. This mismatch arises because the “simp” call tried to rewrite the Boolean values into Prop using nonexistent rewrite rules. (If you want to relate the Boolean test to existential properties, you must carefully choose or prove the appropriate lemmas that exactly match the definitions.)

────────────────────────────
5. Alternative Proof Strategies

To fix these issues you might consider one or more of the following strategies:

• Prove the missing lemmas. Instead of using the names Array.any_eq_true and Array.contains_eq_true, write your own lemmas that state:
  – Array.any a f = true ↔ ∃ i < a.size, f (a[i]!)
  – Array.contains b x = true ↔ ∃ j < b.size, b[j]! = x
Make sure the statements match the definitions in Mathlib.

• Or, avoid calling simp with these unknown lemmas by manually unfolding the definitions using “unfold” and then reasoning directly with the definitions. For example, replace the “simp” call with explicit rewriting and case analysis.

• Verify that the spec and implementation line up with each other. If your implementation returns a Bool and the spec uses an existential statement in Prop, ensure that your rewrite bridges that gap.

────────────────────────────
Root Cause and Direction for Fixing

The root error is that your proof is referencing two constants, Array.any_eq_true and Array.contains_eq_true, that Lean does not know about. In other words, your proof relies on “simplification” lemmas that either have different names (or shapes) in Mathlib or must be proved manually. Also, note that the extraneous or non‐Lean text in your file (the long paragraph about machine learning and Lorem ipsum) may be getting interpreted by Lean if it isn’t properly commented out.

To fix the issue:
1. Remove or comment out any extraneous text that is not valid Lean code.
2. Either import or prove the missing equivalences between your Boolean combinators and the existential statements (that is, build lemmas relating Array.any and Array.contains to the existence of appropriate indices).
3. Replace the “simp […]” call with either those proven lemmas or use explicit rewrites to transform the goal into the desired form.

────────────────────────────
Conclusion

The error arises because your tactic is attempting to simplify using lemmas that have not been defined. Without these lemmas, the proof state does not match the expected specification and Lean reports both an unknown constant as well as unsolved goals. Correcting the problem involves either developing the appropriate lemmas (and then using them in place of the nonexistent names) or manually unfolding the definitions to prove the desired equivalence.

By following one of these directions, you can align your proof’s approach with the specification and satisfy Lean’s type checking.
