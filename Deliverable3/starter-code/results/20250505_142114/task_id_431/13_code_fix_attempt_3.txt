Below is our step‐by‐step analysis and the resulting fixed version of the function implementation.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Identify the code causing the error

• The error arises in the middle of the function definition for hasCommonElement. In the source file, after the line
  a.any (λ x => b.contains x)
there is a line of text:
  This change satisfies Lean 4’s lambda expression syntax requirements and resolves the errors.
This text is not commented out.

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Explain why this is causing an issue

• Lean expects the code to consist of valid Lean expressions. The line beginning with “This” is not a statement or a valid identifier. Instead, Lean tries to interpret “This” as an identifier and fails, hence the “unknown identifier ‘This’” error.
 
──────────────────────────────
Step 3. Consider the type system and Lean 4 requirements

• In Lean, every line in a Lean file must either be valid code or must be properly commented out. Any extraneous text (such as explanations or notes) must be placed in comments (using “--” for single-line comments or “/– … -/” for block comments).
 
──────────────────────────────
Step 4. Think through potential solutions

• We can remove the extraneous text or turn it into a comment. Since the instructions asked for the fixed version of the function implementation only, the simplest solution is to keep only the valid code.

──────────────────────────────
Step 5. Test each solution in your head

• Removing or commenting out the non-code text results in a valid function definition. The lambda expression (λ x => b.contains x) is correctly formed, so Lean will compile without error.

Fixed Version of the Function Implementation

def hasCommonElement (a : Array Int) (b : Array Int) : Bool :=
  a.any (λ x => b.contains x)

──────────────────────────────
With the extraneous text removed (or commented out), Lean will now accept the code without errors.
