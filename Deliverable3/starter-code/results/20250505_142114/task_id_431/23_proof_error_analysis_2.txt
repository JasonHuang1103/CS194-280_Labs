Below is a step‐by‐step analysis of what went wrong and why Lean complained, followed by a summary of the root cause and a suggestion for a fix.

──────────────────────────────
1. Identifying the Failing Tactic and the Error

• The error message “unexpected token ‘·’; expected command” tells us that Lean is stumbling on the bullet “·” that starts a tactic line (for example, “· intro ⟨i, j, h₁, h₂, h₃⟩”). In Lean’s tactic block, bullets (or “case” markers) are allowed only when Lean is in the middle of processing the proof‐script. The error arises because some text which Lean was not expecting appears before the bullet.

• Moreover, the “unsolved goals” messages tell us that after the application of the “constructor” tactic there remain two goals:
  – one for proving (∃ i j, …) → (a.any …) = true,
  – one for proving (a.any …) = true → ∃ i j, ….

Both of these goals are being handled by the two bullet‐led cases. That is, our overall strategy (to prove an “if and only if”) is to split the proof into two parts – one where we assume the existential and prove the boolean is true, and one where we assume the boolean is true and prove the existence of common elements.

2. Considering the Proof State at the Point of Error

• After the “unfold” and “constructor” commands, Lean expects us to provide a rigorous proof for each direction. Roughly speaking, the state is that there are two goals open. In our tactic block immediately after “constructor” we see a bullet “· intro ⟨i, j, h₁, h₂, h₃⟩” corresponding to the first direction.

• At that moment Lean should be reading a tactic command, but instead it finds an “unexpected token” (the bullet “·”) because something isn’t “closed off” properly in the preceding text.

──────────────────────────────
3. Checking if the Proof’s Approach Matches the Specification

• The specification “hasCommonElement_spec a b result” is meant to relate a Boolean result (returned by a.any …) with the proposition that there exist indices i and j such that a[i]! = b[j]!. Our overall proof strategy – splitting the “↔” into two directions – is perfectly natural.

• Each bullet case then attempts to bridge the gap between the Boolean and the existential formulation using lemmas like “Array.any_of_mem” and “Array.mem_of_any”. (Note that there might be other technical details to check about these lemmas, but the error at hand occurs even before we get to any mismatch in these logical steps.)

──────────────────────────────
4. Identifying Type Mismatches or Incorrect Assumptions

• One might worry about comparing a Prop (an existential statement) with a Bool (the result of a.any …). However, the spec is explicitly stated as “(∃ i j, …) ↔ result” so that result is the Boolean returned by our function. Lean supports reasoning about such statements (especially with the help of decidable propositions).

• There doesn’t appear to be any type mismatch in the use of “a.any”, “b.contains”, or the array indexing. Rather, the error is syntactic.

──────────────────────────────
5. Considering Alternative Proof Strategies

• An alternative approach would be to avoid using the “·” bullets by writing each tactic step explicitly with proper indentation, or by ensuring that no extraneous text appears in the tactic block. (Sometimes users also resort to writing multiple “begin … end” blocks in cases where tactic bullets cause parsing issues.)

• Another strategy might be to isolate the proof in a separate file without the “extraneous text” and then slowly reintroduce any comments, ensuring that any non-code paragraphs are fully commented out.

──────────────────────────────
Root Cause and Suggested Fix

The root of the error is not in the logical steps of your proof but rather in the extra non-code text embedded in your file. In your file you have a large text block (about machine learning concepts, overfitting, etc.) that is not commented out. Lean expects only proper code (or clearly marked comments) but finds that extra text where only tactics should appear. In particular, the “unexpected token ‘·’” error comes from Lean misinterpreting the bullets (and possibly preceding text) due to the extraneous material.

To fix the error:
 • Remove or comment out the extraneous text (the lengthy paragraphs about machine learning).
 • Make sure that every non-code text is either completely removed or wrapped inside proper Lean comments (using “--” for line comments or “/– … –/” for block comments).

Once the extraneous text is removed, Lean will correctly parse your tactic bullets and the proof script, and (assuming the lemmas like “Array.any_of_mem” and “Array.mem_of_any” are available and correctly used) the proof will be accepted.

Conclusion

The error came from stray “extraneous text” (non-commented prose) inserted in the file. This extra text corrupted the parsing of tactic bullets (such as “· intro …”), leading to “expected token” and “unsolved goals” errors. The remedy is to remove or properly comment out that extra text so that Lean only sees well-formed code and tactic commands.
