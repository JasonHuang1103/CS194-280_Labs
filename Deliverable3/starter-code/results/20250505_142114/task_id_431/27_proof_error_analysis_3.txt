Below is a step‐by‐step explanation of what went wrong in the proof and why Lean produced the error messages. I will go through each step of the analysis and then conclude with the overall diagnosis and some hints for a fix.

──────────────────────────────  
Step 1. Identify which tactic is failing and why

• The error messages refer to two things:
 – “expected token” on line 9
 – In the proof, when you write
   case mp => … and case mpr => …  
 Lean reports unsolved goals in both branches.  
• Two problems occur:
 1. There is a stray “extraneous text block” (the long line of dashes and accompanying text) in the file. In Lean 4 the parser must see only syntactically legal token streams. Any un-commented text (or text that is not inside a string) will confuse the parser.
 2. The “case mp” and “case mpr” style (or the pattern “case … => …”) is being used in a way that leaves Lean with unsolved sub-goals. In each branch you are trying to prove an equivalence between a Prop (the existence of indices where the elements agree) and a Boolean value (namely, a.any … = true). Lean cannot automatically relate these two (by default, Bool is not the same as Prop without coercions or additional lemmas).

──────────────────────────────  
Step 2. Consider the proof state at that point

• After “unfold hasCommonElement hasCommonElement_spec”, the goal becomes proving
   (∃ i j, i < a.size ∧ j < b.size ∧ a[i]! = b[j]!) ↔ (a.any (λ x, b.contains x) = true).
• In the first direction (case mp), you assume there exist indices with matching elements and you then call “Array.any_of_mem”. However, “Array.any_of_mem” does not automatically convert that information into a proof that a.any … returns true (or equals true)—instead it must somehow prove that the predicate found holds for some element in the array.
• In the second direction (case mpr), you assume a.any … = true and try to “obtain ⟨x, hx⟩ := Array.mem_of_any h” so as to extract a witness; again, you must convert between a Boolean test (a.any … = true) and an existential statement. Without a proper lemma or tactic linking the decision procedure (Bool) with the Prop, the goals remain unsolved.

──────────────────────────────  
Step 3. Check if the proof approach matches the specification

• Your specification is
  (∃ i j, i < a.size ∧ j < b.size ∧ a[i]! = b[j]!) ↔ result
 where result is the outcome of hasCommonElement. Notice that hasCommonElement returns a Bool.
• In Lean one often must separately deal with “decidable” propositions (related to Bool values) and “logical” assertions (of type Prop). Your approach is to relate “result” (a Bool) directly to an existential Prop via ↔, but then the tactics assume that proving “something = true” is as straightforward as proving the Prop. In practice, one needs conversion lemmas to go between “b = true” and the proposition “b”.

──────────────────────────────  
Step 4. Identify any type mismatches or incorrect assumptions

• There’s an underlying type mismatch: you are proving an equivalence between a Prop (an existential statement) and a Bool (obtained by a.any …). Lean does not automatically treat the Boolean “true” as the Prop True.
• The use of “case mp =>” and “case mpr =>” may have been acceptable in some earlier versions or under certain settings, but they require that every branch of the proof completely fills the goal. Because of the mismatch mentioned above (and perhaps missing coercions or extra lemmas like “ofBool” or “toProp”) the proof leaves unsolved goals.
• The extra text (long dash lines or extraneous commentary that is not commented out) inserted in the file also produces “expected token” errors from the parser. When you remove that, Lean no longer complains about the tokens but still raises issues at the “unsolved goals” stage.

──────────────────────────────  
Step 5. Consider alternative proof strategies

• One strategy is to remove any extraneous text. Make sure that any commentary that does not belong in the syntax is either deleted or enclosed in comments (using -- or /- … -/). This will fix the “expected token” errors.
• Next, one may need to explicitly bridge the gap between a Bool value and a Prop. For example, you could either:
  – redefine the specification so that it talks about a.any ... directly as a Bool (or use a coercion that converts it to a Prop), or
  – use lemmas that establish that “a.any predicate = true” is logically equivalent to “∃ x, x ∈ a ∧ predicate x”.
• It might be clearer to prove two separate lemmas:
  Lemma 1: (∃ i j, …) → a.any (λ x, b.contains x) = true  
  Lemma 2: a.any (λ x, b.contains x) = true → ∃ i j, …  
 and then combine them to form the equivalence.

──────────────────────────────  
Conclusion and Root Cause Analysis

The root causes of your proof error are twofold:

1. Extraneous text within your Lean file is not properly commented out. Lines such as the long dashed lines and the “With the extraneous text removed…” note are being parsed as code, causing “expected token” and “unexpected identifier” errors.

2. There is a type mismatch in your proof. You are trying to prove an equivalence between an existential Prop and a Boolean equality (a.any … = true) without using the necessary conversion lemmas or tactics to bridge between Bool and Prop. As a result, the “case mp” and “case mpr” branches do not fully solve their corresponding goals.

──────────────────────────────  
Suggested Direction for a Fix

• Remove (or correctly comment out) any extraneous text so that only valid Lean syntax remains.  
• Adjust the specification or your proof so that you clearly convert between the Boolean result and its corresponding proposition. For example, you might define a lemma along the lines of:
  lemma any_iff_mem (a : Array Int) (p : Int → Bool) :
    a.any p = true ↔ ∃ x, x ∈ a ∧ p x = true
and then use it in your proof.
• Alternatively, change your specification to use Bool instead of Prop when comparing with a.any …, or explicitly use decidable reasoning.

By addressing both the parser-level extraneous text and the proof-level mismatch between Bool and Prop, your proof should compile without unsolved goals.

Happy proving!
