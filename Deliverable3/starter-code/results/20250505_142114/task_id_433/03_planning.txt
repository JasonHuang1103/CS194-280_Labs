Below is our complete reasoning and plan.

─────────────────────────────  
Step 1. Understanding the Function’s Purpose

• We need a function isGreater that takes an integer n and an array a of integers.  
• It must return true if and only if every element of a is strictly less than n; that is, for every index i in a (i < a.size), we have n > a[i]!.  
• In case the array is empty, the universal statement “for all i” is vacuously true so the function should return true.

─────────────────────────────  
Step 2. Breaking Down the Problem

The key tasks are:
1. Iterate through all elements of the array.
2. For each element m, check if n > m.
3. Combine these checks (i.e. “and” them together) to return a single Boolean result.

A natural choice is to use the built-in method Array.all? with the predicate (λ m, n > m). This automatically “folds” the Boolean values (with the “and” operator) over all elements.

─────────────────────────────  
Step 3. Consider Inputs, Edge Cases, and Expected Behavior

• Input types: n is an Int, and a is an Array Int.  
• Edge cases:  
  – When a is empty, Array.all? should return true (because there are no counterexamples).  
  – When at least one element m of a satisfies m ≥ n, the function should yield false.  
• Expected behavior:  
  – isGreater n a = true if and only if ∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!  
  – Otherwise, isGreater n a should be false.

─────────────────────────────  
Step 4. Choosing Proof Techniques

We must prove the specification, recorded as:
  (∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!) ↔ result 
where result is (isGreater n a). The outline of the proof is:

1. Unfold the definitions of isGreater and isGreater_spec.
2. Recognize that our implementation (using Array.all?) is “correct” if we can justify that  
  a.all? (λ m, n > m) = true  ⟺  (∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!)
3. Use existing lemmas from Lean’s List library:  
  – Array.all? is implemented as (a.toList).all? and there is a standard lemma, typically called List.all?_iff_forall, which states that for a list l and predicate p,
   l.all? p = true  ⟺  ∀ x ∈ l, p x = true.
4. Since the list representation of the array has exactly the same elements (with a known correspondence between indices and list membership), the equivalence “lifts” to arrays.

We may proceed by either invoking the known lemma or by a short induction argument on the array. In our proof we will “unfold” the definitions and use rewriting.

─────────────────────────────  
Step 5. Similar Patterns from Examples

The examples provided mention how machine learning algorithms check conditions and use tactics like rewriting and “unfolding” definitions in proofs. Similarly, in our case we “unfold” the definition of isGreater_spec and use known equivalences (like List.all?_iff_forall) to conclude the proof.

Detailed Plan for Implementation and Proof

1. Implementation

 a. Define isGreater using Array.all?:
  def isGreater (n : Int) (a : Array Int) : Bool := a.all? (λ m, n > m)

 b. This expression evaluates to true exactly when n is greater than every element m in a.

2. Statement of the Specification

 a. isGreater_spec is defined to express that
  (∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!) ↔ result

3. Proof of the Specification

 a. Unfold the definitions of isGreater and isGreater_spec.  
 b. Use the fact that a.all? is defined by converting a to a list and applying List.all? with our predicate.  
 c. Apply the lemma List.all?_iff_forall:
   (List.all? (a.toList) (λ m, n > m) = true) ⟺ (∀ m ∈ a.toList, n > m)  
 d. Show that (∀ m ∈ a.toList, n > m) is equivalent to (∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!), using the correspondence between indices in the array and list membership.
 e. Conclude the desired equivalence.

Final Lean 4 Template (Plan)

Below is the plan written in Lean 4 code with explanations:

-----------------------------------------------------------
import Mathlib
import Aesop

-- Implementation: Use Array.all? to check that n > every element in a.
def isGreater (n : Int) (a : Array Int) : Bool :=
  -- We iterate through the array checking n > m for each m in a.
  a.all? (fun m => n > m)

-- Specification:
-- (∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!) ↔ result
def isGreater_spec (n : Int) (a : Array Int) (result : Bool) : Prop :=
  (∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!) ↔ result

-- Theorem: isGreater_spec holds for our implementation.
theorem isGreater_spec_satisfied (n : Int) (a : Array Int) :
  isGreater_spec n a (isGreater n a) := by
  -- Unfold the definitions.
  unfold isGreater isGreater_spec
  -- Notice that a.all? (fun m => n > m) is defined as (a.toList).all? (fun m => n > m).
  -- We now use (or indicate) the known lemma:
  --   List.all?_iff_forall : ∀ (l : List α) (p : α → Bool),
  --                           l.all? p = true ↔ ∀ x ∈ l, p x = true
  -- and the correspondence between a.toList and the array elements.
  -- (The details of this correspondence can be established either by a straightforward induction
  -- or by using auxiliary lemmas from the standard library.)
  sorry
-----------------------------------------------------------

In the proof block, instead of “sorry”, one would elaborate the necessary rewrites:
 – Replace a.all? with (a.toList).all?  
 – Use the lemma List.all?_iff_forall  
 – Show that ∀ m ∈ a.toList, n > m is equivalent to ∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!  
 – Then finish the proof by applying Iff.intro.

─────────────────────────────  
Conclusion

The plan is to implement isGreater using the built-in Array.all? method and then prove that the result is equivalent to the condition “∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!.” The proof will “unfold” the definitions and use the known equivalence between the all? method on arrays (via toList) and universal quantification on the elements. This step-by-step plan effectively meets the problem specifications.
