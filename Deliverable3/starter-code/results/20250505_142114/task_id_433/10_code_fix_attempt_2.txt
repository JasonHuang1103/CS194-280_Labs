Below is our thought process and the final corrected implementation.

––––––––––––––
Step 1. Identify the specific part of the code causing the error  
• The error message points to the expression  
  a.toList.all? (λ m => n > m)  
• Lean complains that there is “invalid field 'all?'”, meaning the List type does not have a method named all?.

––––––––––––––
Step 2. Explain why this is causing an issue  
• In Lean 4’s Mathlib (or the default Lean library in our setup), the List type does not provide a method called all?  
• The existing method that checks if all elements satisfy a predicate is named all (without the question mark).

––––––––––––––
Step 3. Consider the type system and Lean 4 requirements  
• The expression a.toList produces a value of type List Int  
• The expected function should take a predicate Int → Bool and return a Bool  
• The method List.all exists and matches these requirements, hence it is the correct function to use.

––––––––––––––
Step 4. Think through potential solutions  
• One solution is to replace “all?” with “all”.  
• An alternative would be to import a different module that provides an “all?” method, but the simplest fix is to use the already available List.all.

––––––––––––––
Step 5. Test each solution in your head  
• Changing the code to  
  a.toList.all (λ m => n > m)  
  should compile correctly and behave as intended since it converts the array to a list and tests that the predicate holds for every element, returning true if so and false otherwise.

Final Corrected Implementation:

def isGreater (n : Int) (a : Array Int) : Bool :=
  a.toList.all (λ m => n > m)
