Below is our step‐by‐step analysis of the error:

──────────────────────────────
1. Identify which tactic is failing and why

The error message shows two problems. First, we get

  error: simp made no progress

when calling

  simp only [List.all, List.map]

and then

  error: unexpected token 'have'; expected command

at the start of the next line (the line beginning with “have h : …”). In Lean, tactics inside a “by …” proof must be indented so that they are seen as part of the proof block. In our file, the “have” declaration is not indented as part of the tactic block.

──────────────────────────────
2. Consider the proof state at that point

After the initial commands (unfold and simp only), the proof state is still in the same “by” proof block. However, because our “have h : …” line is not indented correctly, Lean interprets it as beginning a new top‐level command rather than continuing in the “by” block. This causes a parser error (“unexpected token 'have'”) because commands such as “have” are not allowed at the top level in this context.

The “simp only [List.all, List.map]” call itself didn’t modify the goal because it was targeting definitions (and sometimes simp does “make no progress”), but that is not fatal. The real issue is the indentation.

──────────────────────────────
3. Check if the proof approach matches the specification

The overall proof strategy is to:
 (a) unfold definitions so that the specification is expressed in terms of List.all,
 (b) show that “∀ m, m ∈ a.toList → n > m” is equivalent to “∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!”, and
 (c) conclude by rewriting the equality given by Bool.ofDecide_eq_iff.

This strategy is sound. The error does not come from a wrong approach or a type mismatch, but rather from how the tactics were written (indented) in the proof block.

──────────────────────────────
4. Identify any type mismatches or incorrect assumptions

There are no type mismatches in this proof snippet. Both directions in the equivalence “have h : …” are correct. The functions and predicates match their intended types. The only misstep is in the “simp only” not simplifying anything (which is fine by itself) and the incorrect indentation that causes Lean to parse “have” out of context.

──────────────────────────────
5. Consider alternative proof strategies

An alternative would be to remove the “simp only [List.all, List.map]” if it does not simplify the goal, or to rearrange the proof so that you explicitly call tactics on the inner parts of the goal. However, the easy fix here is to ensure every tactic is properly indented as part of the “by” block. For example, you could write:

 theorem isGreater_spec_satisfied (n : Int) (a : Array Int) :
  isGreater_spec n a (isGreater n a) := by
  unfold isGreater isGreater_spec
  simp only [List.all, List.map]
  have h : (∀ m, m ∈ a.toList → n > m) ↔ (∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!) := by
   constructor
   · intro h i hi
    have : a[i]! ∈ a.toList := Array.mem_toList a i hi
    exact h _ this
   · intro h m hm
    obtain ⟨i, hi, rfl⟩ := List.mem_toList_iff.1 hm
    exact h i hi
  /rw [Bool.ofDecide_eq_iff, h]

Notice how every line (the “have”, the sub-tactics under “have”, and “rw …”) is consistently indented within the “by” block. That tells Lean that all these are parts of a single proof.

──────────────────────────────
Conclusion and Root Cause

The root cause of the error is not a mistake in your definitions or your intended strategy but a matter of formatting. The “have” command is not indented as part of the tactic block started by “by”; therefore, Lean treats it as a top‑level command where it does not belong. The initial “simp only” call also produced a “made no progress” note, which is only informational unless you expected it to make a change.

──────────────────────────────
Suggested Fix

Indent all tactics inside the “by” block so that they are syntactically part of the proof. For example:

 theorem isGreater_spec_satisfied (n : Int) (a : Array Int) :
  isGreater_spec n a (isGreater n a) := by
  unfold isGreater isGreater_spec
  simp only [List.all, List.map]
  have h : (∀ m, m ∈ a.toList → n > m) ↔ (∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!) := by
   constructor
   · intro h i hi
    have : a[i]! ∈ a.toList := Array.mem_toList a i hi
    exact h _ this
   · intro h m hm
    obtain ⟨i, hi, rfl⟩ := List.mem_toList_iff.1 hm
    exact h i hi
  rw [Bool.ofDecide_eq_iff, h]

This will fix the unexpected token issue and let Lean parse the full proof correctly.

──────────────────────────────
Final Answer

The error is caused by incorrect indentation in the tactic block of your “by” proof. The “have” command (and the following commands) aren’t indented, so Lean does not recognize them as part of the tactic block. Correcting the indentation will make Lean properly parse the proof and resolve the “unexpected token 'have'” error.
