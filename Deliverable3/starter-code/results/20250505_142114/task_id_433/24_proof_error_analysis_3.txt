Below is a step‐by‐step explanation of what went wrong in the proof and how to start fixing it.

─────────────────────────────  
1. Identifying the Failing Tactic

The error message starts with  
  “simp made no progress”  
Even though the simp line itself isn’t “wrong” in the sense that it would lead to an incorrect proof, Lean reports it because the tactic did not change anything. In our proof, we wrote

  simp only [List.all, List.map]

but in the goal nothing was rewritten by these lemmas. (Lean is “helpful” in that it tells us when a simp search command is not doing anything.)  
   
─────────────────────────────  
2. Considering the Proof State at that Point

After the call to simp, the goal remains essentially as  
  (∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!) ↔ a.toList.all (λ m => n > m)

The next scheduled step in the proof is to establish a helper statement

  have h : (∀ m, m ∈ a.toList → n > m) ↔ (∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!)
   := by
     …  

which is expected to bridge the gap between the “list‐world” version and the “array‐world” version of the claim. However, this “have” command is not properly nested inside the proof block.

─────────────────────────────  
3. Matching the Proof Approach to the Specification

The specification is stated as  
  (∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!) ↔ result  
and the implementation returns  
  a.toList.all (λ m => n > m).

Thus, the intended “bridge” is exactly to show that  
  (∀ m, m ∈ a.toList → n > m) ↔ (∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!).

The proof strategy is correct; the idea is to rewrite the “all” condition using decidable equality between the two formulations. The logical step is fine.

4. Identifying Type Mismatches or Incorrect Assumptions

No type mismatch is present in the statement of “h”. The functions and the conversions (using Array.get_mem_toList and List.mem_iff_get) are used correctly. The real issue is not a type error but how the proof script is structured.

─────────────────────────────  
5. Considering Alternative Proof Strategies

One alternative is to avoid the “simp” command entirely if it does not simplify the goal. In that case, one could directly use “rw” (rewrite) commands to bring the goal into the form needed and then apply the “have h” statement. More importantly, it is necessary to keep all the tactic commands inside the same “by” block (or a begin ... end block).

─────────────────────────────  
Root Cause and What to Fix

The error “unexpected token ‘have’; expected command” indicates that Lean encountered the “have” command at the wrong “indentation level.” In Lean’s tactic mode, every command that belongs to the proof must be indented uniformly inside the “by” block. In your code, the “have h : …” is not indented as a continuation of the tactic block that started with

  theorem isGreater_spec_satisfied (n : Int) (a : Array Int) : … := by

That is why after the “simp” command Lean expects further tactics (or the end of the block), but instead it finds “have” at a top-level position. (The “simp made no progress” error simply means that the specific simp you called didn’t change the proof state—it is only a warning and then the parser gets confused by the following token.)

To fix the proof, proceed as follows:
  • Either remove or adjust the “simp only [List.all, List.map]” if it isn’t contributing to the proof.
  • Most importantly, indent all your proof commands so that they remain in the same tactic block. For example:

  theorem isGreater_spec_satisfied (n : Int) (a : Array Int) :
    isGreater_spec n a (isGreater n a) := by
    unfold isGreater isGreater_spec
    -- (Optionally remove or adjust the simp command)
    have h : (∀ m, m ∈ a.toList → n > m) ↔ (∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!) := by
     constructor
     · intro h i hi
       have : a[i]! ∈ a.toList := Array.get_mem_toList _ i hi
       exact h _ this
     · intro h m hm
       obtain ⟨i, hi, rfl⟩ := List.mem_iff_get.1 hm
       exact h i hi
    rw [Bool.of_decide_eq_iff, h]

In this corrected version every tactic (including “have” and “rw”) is indented by the same margin inside the “by” block.

Conclusion

The root cause of the error is not an issue with the logic or the types used in the proof but with the script’s layout: the “have” command was not indented as part of the proof’s tactic block. Additionally, the “simp only” command did not simplify anything, though that in itself is not fatal but might be unnecessary.

A good way to proceed is to fix the indentation so that all commands belong to the same proof block. Once that is done, you might remove the “simp” if it doesn’t contribute to the proof. This restructuring will allow Lean to properly parse and execute the proof tactics.
