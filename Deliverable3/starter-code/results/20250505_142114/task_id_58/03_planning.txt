Below is a step-by-step explanation of the reasoning process along with a detailed plan for both the implementation and the accompanying proof.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Understanding the Function

• The function, hasOppositeSign, takes two integers a and b.
• It must return true if one integer is positive and the other is negative.
• Zero does not count as positive or negative. In other words, if either integer is zero, the function should return false.
• This naturally leads us to checking if (a > 0 ∧ b < 0) or (a < 0 ∧ b > 0).

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Breaking Down the Problem

Sub-problems include:
• Implementing the Boolean check:
  – Check if a is positive and b negative.
  – Check if a is negative and b positive.
• Combining both cases with a logical “or” operator.
• Guaranteeing that when either a or b is zero, both conditions fail.

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. Considering Input Types, Edge Cases, and Expected Behavior

• Input Type: Both a and b are of type Int.
• Edge Cases:
  – When a = 0 or b = 0, neither condition is satisfied so the result is false.
  – When both are positive or both are negative, similarly false.
• Expected Behavior: The function returns true if and only if one integer is positive and the other is negative.

──────────────────────────────
Step 4. Choosing the Proof Technique

• The specification expressed by hasOppositeSign_spec is:
  (a < 0 ∧ b > 0) ∨ (a > 0 ∧ b < 0) ↔ result
• Since our implementation will match that Boolean expression exactly (the order of the disjuncts is immaterial), the proof can be done by simply unfolding the definitions and using reflexivity (rfl).
• The proof technique is to unfold both the implementation and the spec and then see that they are definitionally equal—the algebraic structure of the Boolean expression is identical.

──────────────────────────────
Step 5. Similar Patterns and Examples

• Lean examples where one unfolds definitions and uses rfl for proofs show that if the implementation mirrors the specification exactly, one may finish the proof by reflexivity.
• The given Lean 4 template is structured to allow unfolding the definitions and then closing the goal with rfl.

Final Detailed Plan

1. Implementation:
  – Define hasOppositeSign such that it returns the Boolean expression:
   (a > 0 && b < 0) || (a < 0 && b > 0).
  – This implementation directly mirrors our understanding of checking for opposite signs without extra complications.

2. Proof:
  – Unfold the definitions of hasOppositeSign and hasOppositeSign_spec.
  – Observe that the specification becomes:
   ((a < 0 ∧ b > 0) ∨ (a > 0 ∧ b < 0)) ↔ ((a > 0 && b < 0) || (a < 0 && b > 0))
  – Since the Boolean operators and the logical connectives correspond in our setting, the goal is met by applying rfl.

Final Lean 4 Code

Below is the completed Lean 4 code that follows the plan:

------------------------------------------------------------
import Mathlib
import Aesop

-- Implementation
def hasOppositeSign (a : Int) (b : Int) : Bool :=
  -- The function returns true if one number is positive and the other negative.
  (a > 0 && b < 0) || (a < 0 && b > 0)


-- Theorem Specification: The result is true if a and b have opposite signs
def hasOppositeSign_spec (a : Int) (b : Int) (result : Bool) : Prop :=
  (a < 0 ∧ b > 0) ∨ (a > 0 ∧ b < 0) ↔ result

-- Theorem: Prove that the implementation satisfies the specification
theorem hasOppositeSign_spec_satisfied (a : Int) (b : Int) :
  hasOppositeSign_spec a b (hasOppositeSign a b) := by
  -- Unfold the definitions.
  unfold hasOppositeSign hasOppositeSign_spec
  -- The two sides are definitionally equal.
  rfl
------------------------------------------------------------

Conclusion

The reasoning involved:
 • Correctly understanding the requirements.
 • Breaking the problem into implementing the Boolean check and handling edge cases.
 • Designing the proof by unfolding definitions.
 • Recognizing that the implementation and specification are structurally identical so rfl completes the proof.

This completes both the implementation and the proof plan in Lean 4.
