Below is a step‐by‐step analysis of what’s going wrong in your proof.

─────────────────────────────  
Step 1. Which tactic is failing and why  
─────────────────────────────  
After you “unfold” the definitions and “simp” using the lemmas for Boolean connectives (Bool.and_eq_true and Bool.or_eq_true), the goal becomes an equivalence (↔) between two disjunctions. One side is  
  (a < 0 ∧ 0 < b) ∨ (0 < a ∧ b < 0)  
and the other side is  
  0 < a ∧ b < 0 ∨ a < 0 ∧ 0 < b.  
Although these two are logically equivalent, your “constructor” tactic breaks the goal into two implications and then you use “exact h” in each branch. The “exact” tactic expects the term to be definitionally the same as the goal. Because the disjunctions are written in a different order (by the commutativity of ∨ they are equivalent, but not definitionally identical), Lean cannot close the goal by “exact h”.  

─────────────────────────────  
Step 2. Consider the proof state at that point  
─────────────────────────────  
After the “simp” call the proof state is similar to:  

  a, b : ℤ  
  ⊢ (a < 0 ∧ 0 < b) ∨ (0 < a ∧ b < 0) ↔ (0 < a ∧ b < 0) ∨ (a < 0 ∧ 0 < b)  

When you invoke “constructor”, Lean creates two separate goals: one for the → direction and one for the ← direction. In one branch you’re given h where the disjunct order matches one side, but “exact h” then fails on the other branch because of the order mismatch between the two sides of the disjunction.

─────────────────────────────  
Step 3. Check if the proof approach matches the specification  
─────────────────────────────  
Your specification states that the Boolean function result should be equivalent to the proposition that a and b have opposite signs. You correctly “unfold” the definitions; however, the use of simp with the Boolean-to-prop lemmas leads to disjunctions with swapped order. In essence, your approach is valid, but the issue is that you must bridge the gap between “logically equivalent” and “definitionally equal” in Lean.

─────────────────────────────  
Step 4. Identify any type mismatches or incorrect assumptions  
─────────────────────────────  
There isn’t a type mismatch in the sense of comparing a Bool to a Prop—the “and_eq_true” and “or_eq_true” lemmas provide the necessary conversion. Instead, the problem arises because the two disjunctions differ by a permutation (they are commutative but not definitionally identical). The “exact” tactic is too strict and does not account for this rearrangement in the order of the disjuncts.

─────────────────────────────  
Step 5. Consider alternative proof strategies  
─────────────────────────────  
There are several ways you could address the issue:
• Use the lemma “or_comm” to rearrange one side of the equivalence. For example, in one of the implications you might rewrite the disjunction so that the orders align.
• Instead of “exact h”, consider a tactic such as “assumption” or “rw or_comm” to explicitly swap the order, or use “apply propext” together with known equivalences.
• Alternatively, you can complete the proof in one line with “dec_trivial” or “rfl” after showing that both sides are logically equivalent by definition.

─────────────────────────────  
Conclusion and Root Cause Analysis  
─────────────────────────────  
The root cause is that after unfolding and simp, the equivalence you need to prove involves two disjunctions whose components are written in different orders. Although the propositions are logically equivalent (by the commutativity of ∨), Lean’s definitional equality check does not see them as identical. The “exact h” tactic only works if the goal is exactly (definitionally equal to) h. To fix this, you should explicitly account for the commutativity of disjunction. For example, you might add a rewrite using “or_comm” in one of the cases or adjust the proof so that both sides match exactly before using “exact”. This ensures that Lean can see the equality and close the goals.

A possible fix might be to add a rewrite like this:  

  · intros h  
    rw [or_comm] at h  
    cases h  
    · left; exact h  
    · right; exact h  

or rewrite one of the goals using “rw or_comm” so that the orders align, letting “exact h” finish the proof.

By making sure the order of the disjuncts is the same on both sides of the equivalence, Lean’s “exact” tactic will succeed.
