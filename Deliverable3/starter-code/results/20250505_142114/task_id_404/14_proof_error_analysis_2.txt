Below is our analysis of the error step‐by‐step:

────────────────────────────────────────
1. Which tactic is failing and why

The proof uses the tactic sequence

  unfold myMin myMin_spec  
  split  
   case myMin_spec.left => … by_cases …  
   ...
  split  
   case myMin_spec.right => … by_cases …

In the “left” case (the first conjunct) the proof does a case analysis on the condition a ≤ b. In the false branch (a ≤ b is false) the code is

  by_cases h : a ≤ b  
  case isFalse =>
   simp [myMin, h]  
   exact lt_of_not_ge h

The error message tells us that the “unsolved goals” are in the isFalse case for the “left” conjunct: the goal that remains is

  (b ≤ a ∧ b ≤ b)

The tactic “exact lt_of_not_ge h” is meant to produce b < a (from ¬ (a ≤ b)) and then—presumably—this should imply b ≤ a; but this only addresses one half of the conjunction. (In the true branch, the simplification does not solve both conjuncts either.) In short, the tactic “exact lt_of_not_ge h” is being used to solve a goal that requires two parts.

────────────────────────────────────────
2. Consider the proof state at that point

In the isFalse branch (when a ≤ b is false), after unfolding definitions and simp with the rewrite rules [myMin, h], the goal becomes

  (b ≤ a ∧ b ≤ b)

Note that b ≤ b is trivial (by reflexivity), but b ≤ a is not immediately solved by “simp” or “lt_of_not_ge h” because:

 • lt_of_not_ge h gives a proof of b < a,
 • and while b < a does imply b ≤ a, the tactic “exact” is only trying to solve the whole conjunction in one go.

There is an unsolved conjunct, which is what Lean is complaining about.

────────────────────────────────────────
3. Check if the proof approach matches the specification

The specification myMin_spec states that the result (which is myMin a b) satisfies:

  (result ≤ a ∧ result ≤ b) ∧ (result = a ∨ result = b).

Looking at the structure of the proof we see that the overall approach is to “split” the conjunction and then do a case analysis on the if-condition (by_cases h : a ≤ b) in each part. This idea is sound; however, within each branch we must prove a conjunction. In the “false” branch of the left conjunct, two separate subgoals remain (one for each inequality) and our script does not “split” or otherwise provide a proof for both pieces.

────────────────────────────────────────
4. Identify any type mismatches or incorrect assumptions

There is no direct type mismatch. Rather, the error comes because we try to use “exact lt_of_not_ge h” (which provides a proof of b < a) to solve a goal that is a conjunction (b ≤ a ∧ b ≤ b). We need not only the fact that b < a (which gives b ≤ a when combined with the appropriate lemma such as le_of_lt) but also a proof that b ≤ b. In our isFalse branch, we must explicitly split the goal and handle both parts.

Also note that the second “split” (for myMin_spec.right) might be misplaced or mis‐formatted (perhaps an indentation issue) causing the “unexpected identifier; expected command” error. In Lean 4, the indentation of tactic blocks may affect the parsing, so the second “split” should be at the same level as the first one if it is meant to be a new separate tactic block.

────────────────────────────────────────
5. Consider alternative proof strategies

A few alternative strategies might help:
 • Instead of using a top‐level “split” to treat the overall conjunction and then doing a by_cases inside the left and right parts separately, you could do a single case analysis on (a ≤ b) and then split the goals inside each case. That is, first “by_cases h : a ≤ b” and then prove:
  – when h holds: show (a ≤ a ∧ a ≤ b) ∧ (a = a ∨ a = b) (which is mostly trivial),
  – when h does not hold: show (b ≤ a ∧ b ≤ b) ∧ (b = a ∨ b = b) (again trivial once you split the conjunctions properly).
 • In any branch where you need to prove a conjunction, use tactics like “split” (or “constructor”) and prove each subgoal separately. For example, in the isFalse branch you might write:
  split  
   exact le_of_lt (lt_of_not_ge h)  
   exact le_refl b  
 • Make sure the indentation in your tactic script is consistent so that Lean knows which tactics go with which goal.

────────────────────────────────────────
Conclusion and Recommendation

The root cause of the error is that in your proof you attempt to solve a conjunction goal with a single “exact” call. In particular, in the branch when a ≤ b is false, the goal is to prove (b ≤ a ∧ b ≤ b), but your proof only supplies a proof of b ≤ a (via lt_of_not_ge h, after converting b < a to b ≤ a) and never addresses the trivial fact that b ≤ b. Moreover, the structure (and possibly the indentation) of your two “split” tactics is causing the parser to get confused.

To fix the proof you should:

1. Refactor the proof so that case analysis on a ≤ b occurs at the beginning. For example:

  by_cases h : a ≤ b  
  · -- In the case a ≤ b; then myMin a b = a.
   split  
    { exact ⟨le_refl a, h⟩ }  
    { exact Or.inl rfl }  
  · -- In the case ¬ a ≤ b; then myMin a b = b.
   split  
    { split  
     { exact le_of_lt (lt_of_not_ge h) }  
     { exact le_refl b } }  
    { exact Or.inr rfl }

2. Alternatively, if you wish to keep the current “split” first then case split later, be sure to use “split” within each by_cases branch to treat each conjunct separately, and check your indentation so that each “case” is parsed as part of your overall tactic block.

This restructuring will both supply proofs for all parts of the desired conjunction and match Lean’s expectations on tactic indentation.

────────────────────────────────────────
Final Analysis

Your error occurs because your proof script in the branch when a ≤ b is false does not supply proofs for both conjuncts required (b ≤ a and b ≤ b) and your indentation might be mis-parsing the second “split”. You need to decompose the proof so that in each case (when a ≤ b or not) you split and prove each part of the conjunction with the appropriate lemmas (using, for example, le_refl for the trivial inequality and le_of_lt on lt_of_not_ge h for the nontrivial one).

A good starting point is to restructure your proof to first perform the case analysis on the if-condition and then use separate “split” tactics for proving the conjuncts in each branch. This will solve the “unsolved goals” error and “unexpected identifier” error caused by indentation problems.

By following these suggestions, you should have a proof that satisfies the specification without tactic errors.
