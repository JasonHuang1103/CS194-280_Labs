Below is our detailed reasoning and plan for implementing and proving the specification.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Understanding the Function’s Purpose

• According to the problem, our function myMin must take two integers a and b and return the smaller one.
• When a and b are equal, returning either is acceptable.
• In Lean we can encode this by comparing a and b: if a ≤ b then a else b.

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Breaking down the problem into subproblems

1. Implementation:
  – Write the function definition for myMin.
  – Use an if-then-else expression that checks whether a ≤ b.
  – Return a if a ≤ b holds; otherwise, return b.

2. Specification:
  – The theorem myMin_spec describes two requirements:
     a. The result must be less than or equal to both a and b.
     b. The result must be equal to either a or b.

3. Proof:
  – To prove myMin_spec_satisfied, we “unfold” the definitions.
  – Then perform a case analysis based on whether a ≤ b is true or not.
  – In the first case (a ≤ b), the function returns a, and we prove:
     • a ≤ a (by reflexivity)
     • a ≤ b (by the assumption)
     • And a = a (which directly satisfies the alternative “result = a ∨ result = b”).
  – In the second case (¬ (a ≤ b); i.e. a > b), the function returns b and we show:
     • b ≤ b (by reflexivity)
     • b ≤ a holds because a > b (remember ≤ is total on integers)
     • And b = b will satisfy the disjunction.

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. Considering Inputs, Edge Cases, and Expected Behavior

• The inputs are integers.
• Edge cases include:
  – a equals b, in which case our if-condition a ≤ b will hold and return a.
  – a less than b, then returning a properly satisfies result ≤ b.
  – a greater than b, then returning b satisfies result ≤ a.
• In all cases, the return value is one of the inputs and is indeed less or equal to both.

──────────────────────────────
Step 4. Proof Techniques

• We will use conditional reasoning (if-then-else) and a case split based on the condition a ≤ b.
• In each branch we apply reflexivity for equalities and use the assumptions to establish the ≤ properties.
• The structure of the theorem proof is to “unfold” the definitions and then handle both cases separately.

──────────────────────────────
Step 5. Similar Patterns and Examples

• The Lean documentation often uses if-then-else and case analysis (or by simp) to simplify proofs.
• The examples given in the documentation point to using cases on conditionals and then employing reflexivity and the assumption to achieve the proof goals.
• Our structure is similar to common proofs for minimum functions, where we show one branch returns a and in that branch a has the desired properties; the other branch similarly returns b.

──────────────────────────────
Detailed Plan for Implementation and Proof

1. Implementation:
  – Define the myMin function:
   def myMin (a : Int) (b : Int) : Int :=
    if a ≤ b then a else b

2. Theorem Statement:
  – The spec predicate myMin_spec ensures:
   (Result ≤ a ∧ Result ≤ b) ∧ (Result = a ∨ Result = b)

3. Proof:
  – Begin the proof by unfolding definitions.
  – Use a case split on the if-condition:
   Case 1: a ≤ b.
    • Show that a ≤ a (trivial) and a ≤ b (from our assumption).
    • Conclude that the result is either a or b (here, it is a).
   Case 2: ¬ (a ≤ b) (i.e. a > b).
    • Show that b ≤ a holds because a > b implies b < a, and hence b ≤ a.
    • Also b ≤ b holds by reflexivity.
    • Conclude that the result is b, fulfilling the condition result = a ∨ result = b.
  – In Lean, these two cases are handled with the “if … then … else …” construct and then applying tactics such as split, intro, assumption, and exact.

Conclusion

We started by clearly understanding the task: myMin returns the smaller of two integers. Then we decomposed the problem into the function implementation and two proof obligations: one for the ≤ properties and one for the equality alternative. Using a case split on the if-condition allowed us to prove that myMin returns a value that satisfies both parts of the specification. Finally, we laid out the complete Lean 4 code for both the implementation and its proof.
