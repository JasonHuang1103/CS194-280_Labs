Below is a step‐by‐step explanation of the issues, along with our reasoning and a suggestion for a fix.

─────────────────────────────  
Step 1. Identify which tactic is failing and why

The error message shows that the tactic "aesop" is the one that eventually “failed” in proving the goal. In several of the case splits generated by unfolding the definition (see “case left”, “case right”, etc.), the goals that remain involve showing things like

  c ≤ a

even though one of the hypotheses is

  h₁ : c < a

Thus, in each failing case aesop is left with a goal that asks for a non‐strict inequality (≤) even though a strict inequality (<) is available in the context. In Lean, the tactical gap comes from the fact that aesop does not “automatically” convert a strict inequality into a non‐strict one even though mathematically c < a implies c ≤ a.

─────────────────────────────  
Step 2. Consider the proof state at that point

After unfolding the definitions of minOfThree and minOfThree_spec, we have several branches depending on the conditions generated by the if–then–else structure. For example, one branch gives us the following:
 • a ≤ b,
 • c < a
with the goal
  ⊢ c ≤ a.
Although this goal is (mathematically) true because c < a implies c ≤ a, Lean does not automatically close such goals unless we provide the appropriate lemma or tactic. The same situation happens for other branches (e.g. deriving c ≤ b or b ≤ a when only a strict inequality such as c < a or b < a is available in the hypotheses).

─────────────────────────────  
Step 3. Check if the proof approach matches the specification

The overall strategy is to show that minOfThree returns one of the three inputs and that this returned number is less than or equal to all inputs. The specification (minOfThree_spec) breaks into two parts—a “lower bound” condition and a “returned value is one of the inputs” condition. The error is not due to a flaw in the specification but rather in how some branches of the conditionals (using strict inequalities) misalign with the goal that asks for weak (non‐strict) inequalities. In short, the approach is conceptually correct but the conversion from strict to non‐strict inequalities is not handled automatically.

─────────────────────────────  
Step 4. Identify any type mismatches or incorrect assumptions

The type “ℤ” (integers) supports both < and ≤, but they are not definitionally the same. For instance, a hypothesis h₁ : c < a is a statement that c is strictly less than a. The goal, however, is c ≤ a. Well-known lemmas (for instance, in Lean’s mathlib) show that for any integers, c < a implies c ≤ a. The issue is that aesop is not “seeing” or applying such a lemma automatically.

Similarly, other branches require showing (e.g.) that c < a and a ≤ b imply c ≤ b via transitivity but again require explicit help. So the mismatch is between having a strict inequality (of type <) and the goal being a weak inequality (of type ≤).

─────────────────────────────  
Step 5. Consider alternative proof strategies

Because the proof is ultimately about arithmetic inequalities, relying solely on aesop may not close such goals automatically. Some alternatives include:

 • Using arithmetic-aware tactics like “linarith” after unfolding, which can automatically bridge strict/weak inequality gaps.
 • Explicitly invoking lemmas that convert strict inequalities to non‐strict ones (for example, using “lt.le” on a hypothesis of type c < a to obtain c ≤ a).
 • Combine aesop with these additional tactics where it “fails” to apply the conversion.

─────────────────────────────  
Conclusion: Detailed Analysis and Suggested Direction

The root cause of the error is that upon unfolding the definitions in the proof of theorem minOfThree_spec_satisfied, some cases yield hypotheses (such as c < a or b < a) while the goals require non‐strict inequalities (c ≤ a, c ≤ b, b ≤ a, etc.). Although mathematically c < a implies c ≤ a, aesop does not automatically perform that conversion.

To fix this, you might:
 – Insert an explicit conversion using an appropriate lemma (e.g., “apply lt.le h₁” or “exact h₁.le”) where needed.
 – Alternatively, when you reach a point where there remains an arithmetic goal, use the “linarith” tactic to automatically resolve these inequalities.

For example, one possible modification to the proof could be:

------------------------------------------------
theorem minOfThree_spec_satisfied (a : Int) (b : Int) (c : Int) :
  minOfThree_spec a b c (minOfThree a b c) := by
  unfold minOfThree minOfThree_spec
  -- Use aesop to solve as much as possible:
  aesop?
  -- For the remaining arithmetic goals, use linarith:
  linarith
------------------------------------------------

This instructs Lean to first use aesop and then defer to linarith for solving the remaining arithmetic (inequality) goals.

In summary, the error is due to strict inequalities appearing in the context while the goal uses weak inequalities, and aesop on its own does not bridge that gap. Adapting your proof by explicitly converting or by using tactics like linarith should resolve the issue.
