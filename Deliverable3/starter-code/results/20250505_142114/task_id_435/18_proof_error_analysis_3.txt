Below is a step‐by‐step analysis of what’s wrong with your proof and some suggestions for fixing it.

──────────────────────────────
1. The Failing Tactic

• The error message tells you that the tactic "split" “failed” and is followed by an “unexpected identifier” error on the very next line.
• In Lean’s tactic proof mode the “split” tactic is meant to decompose a goal that is a conjunction into two separate subgoals.
• Here your overall goal (after unfolding) is
  (0 ≤ n % 10 ∧ n % 10 < 10) ∧ n % 10 = n % 10
  so “split” should work.
• However, the error indicates that either Lean cannot apply split or (more likely) that the subsequent tactics are not being parsed as part of the same tactic block.

──────────────────────────────
2. The Proof State at the Point of Failure

• After “unfold lastDigit lastDigit_spec” the goal is exactly:
  (0 ≤ n % 10 ∧ n % 10 < 10) ∧ n % 10 = n % 10
• “split” is supposed to break that into two subgoals:
  a. 0 ≤ n % 10 ∧ n % 10 < 10
  b. n % 10 = n % 10
• Your proof then attempts to handle both subgoals with:
  apply And.intro
  apply Nat.mod_lt n 10; decide
  rfl

──────────────────────────────
3. Does the Proof Match the Specification?

• The intent is correct: you want to show that the result is between 0 and 9 and that it is computed as n % 10.
• In the first part of the conjunction, you want to show 0 ≤ n % 10 and n % 10 < 10 (by applying Nat.mod_lt with a side condition, solved using “decide”).
• In the second part, you want to show the equality n % 10 = n % 10, which is proved by “rfl.”
• Thus, conceptually, your approach is sound.

──────────────────────────────
4. Type Mismatches or Incorrect Assumptions

• There is no problem with the types or the assumptions: the specification and the result match.
• The issue doesn’t come from a wrong mathematical assumption but rather from how the tactics are structured in the proof.

──────────────────────────────
5. Alternative Proof Strategies and the Root Cause

• The error “unexpected identifier” typically arises when Lean cannot correctly tell that some tactic commands belong inside the “by” block.
• In Lean 4, tactic proofs are sensitive to layout and indentation. In your code the “apply And.intro” appears at the same (top-level) indentation as “split.” This causes Lean to think that line is a new command outside of the tactic block or it confuses the internal structure of the block.
• One alternative is to fix the indentation so that all sub-tactics after “split” are indented by at least two spaces (or to use tactical bullets). For example, you can structure the proof as follows:

  theorem lastDigit_spec_satisfied (n : Nat) :
    lastDigit_spec n (lastDigit n) := by
    unfold lastDigit lastDigit_spec
    split
    · apply Nat.mod_lt n 10; decide
    · rfl

• Notice the “·” bullet (or simply indenting) tells Lean that the tactics belong to the respective subgoal slot created by “split.”
• Alternatively, you could avoid “split” altogether and use “constructor” which also creates the two required subgoals.

Conclusion and Suggested Fix

The root cause of the error is that though your strategy is correct, the tactic mode block isn’t properly structured when using “split.” The subsequent tactic “apply And.intro” (and the tactics following it) are not indented or organized in a way that Lean’s parser expects. Lean is confused by the layout, so it fails with “unexpected identifier.”

To fix the error:
• Re-indent the lines following “split” so that they clearly belong to the proof of the subgoals.
• Optionally, use bullet points (e.g. “·”) to separate the proofs for the two parts of the conjunction.

A corrected version might look like the example above. This signals to Lean that the tactics are part of the same tactic block and belong to the subgoals generated by “split.”

By addressing the layout/indentation, the error should be resolved and your proof will check as expected.
