Below is a step-by-step analysis of the proof error, following the requested steps.

──────────────────────────────
1. Tactic Failing and Why

• The failing tactic is the simp tactic. After unfolding the definitions of lastDigit and lastDigit_spec, simp quickly deals with the equality n % 10 = n % 10 and the inequality 0 ≤ n % 10 (since every natural number is at least 0). However, it gets stuck on the goal “n % 10 < 10.”
  
• The inequality n % 10 < 10 is true, but simp does not automatically know or apply the arithmetic lemma that shows this fact. Typically, one would use the lemma Nat.mod_lt, which requires showing that the divisor (here 10) is positive.

──────────────────────────────
2. The Proof State at That Point

After unfolding and running simp, Lean has reduced the goal to proving:
  n % 10 < 10

The other parts of the specification have been solved. Now the only unsolved goal is showing the remainder when n is divided by 10 is strictly less than 10. In Lean’s math library, there is a well-known lemma, Nat.mod_lt, that states:
  Nat.mod_lt n 10 (by decide)
if 10 > 0, which would solve the goal.

──────────────────────────────
3. Matching the Proof Approach to the Specification

• The specification lastDigit_spec requires that the output is between 0 and 9 (i.e., 0 ≤ d and d < 10) and that it satisfies n % 10 = d.

• The proof approach unfolds the definitions and uses simp to simplify. This strategy works for the equality and the lower bound 0 ≤ n % 10 because these are trivial. However, the approach falls short for the inequality n % 10 < 10 because simp does not invoke the arithmetic reasoning needed to establish this fact.

──────────────────────────────
4. Type Mismatches or Incorrect Assumptions

• There is no type mismatch. The types involved are all Nat and Prop, and the statement n % 10 < 10 is a well-typed proposition.

• The assumption that simp would automatically verify the inequality is incorrect. In Lean, specific lemmas about arithmetic (like Nat.mod_lt) need to be applied explicitly or have their associated rewriting rules enabled. In this case, simp does not automatically apply Nat.mod_lt.

──────────────────────────────
5. Alternative Proof Strategies

• To fix the issue, an explicit application of Nat.mod_lt is needed. For example, one could replace the simp tactic with a combination of simp and apply:
  • unfold lastDigit lastDigit_spec
  • simp
  • apply Nat.mod_lt n 10 (by decide)
  
• Alternatively, one could use a tactic like exact to supply the remaining proof:
  exact Nat.mod_lt n 10 (by decide)
  
• Another option would be to use a more powerful tactic (like Aesop or ring) to manage basic arithmetic inequalities if configured properly in your project.

──────────────────────────────
Root Cause and Direction for Fixing the Error

The root cause is that the simp tactic does not automatically prove the arithmetic fact n % 10 < 10. Even though this fact is true (by the standard lemma Nat.mod_lt, once you note that 10 > 0), simp is not set up to apply that lemma in this context.

To fix the error:

1. Replace the simp tactic with an explicit proof of n % 10 < 10.
2. For example, change your proof to:
  theorem lastDigit_spec_satisfied (n : Nat) :
   lastDigit_spec n (lastDigit n) := by
   unfold lastDigit lastDigit_spec
   simp
   apply Nat.mod_lt n 10 (by decide)

This will explicitly apply Nat.mod_lt to show that n % 10 is less than 10, satisfying the last part of the specification.

──────────────────────────────
Conclusion

The error arises because after simplifying, Lean is left with the goal n % 10 < 10, which requires an arithmetic lemma (Nat.mod_lt) to prove since simp does not automatically provide it. By applying Nat.mod_lt explicitly with the proof that 10 > 0 (e.g., using “by decide”), you can resolve the unsolved goal and complete the proof correctly.
