Below is an explanation of the reasoning behind the solution, broken into concrete steps, followed by a final plan and the complete Lean 4 code.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Understand the function's requirement:
• The function, ident, must take x : Nat and return the same natural number. Thus the intended behavior is the identity function.

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Break the problem into subproblems:
a) Implementation:  
   • The function definition is straightforward; simply return x.
b) Specification:  
   • The specification (ident_spec) states that the result equals x.
c) Proof:  
   • We need to show that ident_spec x (ident x) holds, i.e., that x = x.
   • The proof in Lean will unfold the definitions and then use reflexivity (rfl).

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. Consider the input types, edge cases, and expected behavior:
• The input is a natural number (Nat).  
• There are no edge cases beyond needing to handle any natural number since the identity function behaves uniformly for all inputs.

──────────────────────────────
Step 4. Proof techniques:
• The natural approach is to use the unfold tactic to expand the definitions of ident and ident_spec.
• Since the resulting equation is trivial (x = x), we can complete the proof using reflexivity (rfl).

──────────────────────────────
Step 5. Similar patterns and previous examples:
• Identity functions and their proofs often follow a pattern of simply returning the input and then showing that the returned value is equal to the input.
• The pattern “unfold ...; rfl” is common in Lean proofs when the equality is directly by the definition of the function.

──────────────────────────────
Detailed Implementation and Proof Plan:
1. In the implementation section, define ident as:  
     def ident (x : Nat) : Nat := x  
   This meets the requirement of "returning the same natural number."
2. In the proof:
   • Unfold the definitions of both ident and ident_spec.
   • After unfolding, the goal becomes x = x.
   • Apply rfl to conclude the proof since the equality holds by reflexivity.

──────────────────────────────
Final Lean 4 Code:

import Mathlib
import Aesop

-- Implementation
def ident (x : Nat) : Nat :=
  -- << CODE START >>
  x
  -- << CODE END >>

def ident_spec (x : Nat) (result: Nat) : Prop :=
  -- << SPEC START >>
  result = x
  -- << SPEC END >>

theorem ident_spec_satisfied (x : Nat) :
  ident_spec x (ident x) := by
  -- << PROOF START >>
  unfold ident ident_spec
  rfl
  -- << PROOF END >>

──────────────────────────────
This plan first identifies the straightforward nature of the identity function. It then outlines the splitting of the problem into implementation and proof tasks. Finally, by noting that the expected equality holds by definition (using rfl), we conclude the solution is complete with both the implementation and a concise proof.
