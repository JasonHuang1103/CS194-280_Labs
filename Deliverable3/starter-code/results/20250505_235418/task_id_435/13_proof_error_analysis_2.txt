Below is a step‐by‐step explanation of what’s going wrong with your proof and a suggestion for how to fix it.

──────────────────────────────
1. Identifying the Failing Tactic

After you do

  unfold lastDigit lastDigit_spec  
  simp

you call

  apply And.intro

which splits the goal into two parts. The first part is to show 0 ≤ n % 10 and the second is to show n % 10 < 10. The first goal is discharged by

  · exact Nat.zero_le (n % 10)

but the second goal is still open and you try to solve it by

  · exact Nat.mod_lt n 10 (by decide)

The error message

  n : ℕ ⊢ n % 10 < 10

indicates that the second subgoal remains unsolved. Moreover, the “unexpected identifier” error that appears afterward is a symptom that the proof block did not finish properly because Lean wasn’t able to use the provided expression as a complete proof.

──────────────────────────────
2. Considering the Proof State

At the point where you invoke the second bullet, Lean’s goal is

  n % 10 < 10

Because of the way you applied And.intro, you should have a term proving n % 10 < 10. You attempt to build such a term by calling Nat.mod_lt with arguments n, 10, and a proof of 0 < 10. However, the proof for 0 < 10 is written as (by decide) inside the term (i.e. as an argument to Nat.mod_lt).

──────────────────────────────
3. Checking the Proof Approach Against the Specification

Your overall approach is on track since the specification demands both that the result is between 0 and 9 and that n % 10 equals that result—and you split the goal using And.intro. In principle, this is exactly what you want.

──────────────────────────────
4. Identifying the Problem: Type Mismatch and Misuse of Tactic Mode

The issue is with the argument (by decide) passed to Nat.mod_lt. In Lean 4 you cannot use tactic mode (using “by …”) inside a regular term-level argument. The expression

  Nat.mod_lt n 10 (by decide)

is trying to use “by decide” in a place where Lean expects a term (i.e. a proof value) rather than an interactive tactic block. In other words, “by decide” is a tactic, not an expression that can be passed as an argument to a function.

──────────────────────────────
5. Considering an Alternative Proof Strategy

There are at least two ways to fix this:

A. Provide a proper term that proves 0 < 10. For instance, you can replace (by decide) with a term like dec_trivial (if you have dec_trivial available) or another expression proving 0 < 10. One option is dec_trivial, which is a term-level proof generated by Lean’s decision procedure.

B. Instead of “wrapping” the call to Nat.mod_lt in a term, you can let the tactic “decide” do its work in tactic mode. For example, after applying And.intro and solving the first goal, you can switch to tactic mode to solve the second goal by writing simply “decide” or “exact dec_trivial”.

──────────────────────────────
Detailed Root Cause and Suggested Fix

The root cause is that you’re using tactic syntax “by decide” inside an expression:
  Nat.mod_lt n 10 (by decide)
Here Lean expects an expression (or term) of type “0 < 10” but “by decide” is a tactic block (similar to how “sorry” might be used). This mismatch is what leaves a goal unsolved and causes the subsequent unexpected identifier error.

One way to fix your proof is to change your second bullet to either use a valid term proof or remove “by decide” from the term-level expression. For example, you might write:

  theorem lastDigit_spec_satisfied (n : Nat) :
    lastDigit_spec n (lastDigit n) := by
    unfold lastDigit lastDigit_spec
    simp
    apply And.intro
    · exact Nat.zero_le (n % 10)
    · exact Nat.mod_lt n 10 dec_trivial

Here, dec_trivial is a valid term-level proof that 0 < 10. Alternatively, you could solve the second goal interactively:

  theorem lastDigit_spec_satisfied (n : Nat) :
    lastDigit_spec n (lastDigit n) := by
    unfold lastDigit lastDigit_spec
    simp
    constructor
    · exact Nat.zero_le (n % 10)
    · decide

──────────────────────────────
Conclusion

The error stems from using "by decide" in a term context (as an argument to Nat.mod_lt) rather than in a tactic script. Lean expects a term that proves 0 < 10 but receives tactic syntax instead. Replacing “by decide” with a proper term proof such as dec_trivial or moving the tactic into tactic mode (for example, using “decide” at the appropriate bullet) should fix the error.

This analysis should guide you in revising your proof so that Lean accepts it.
