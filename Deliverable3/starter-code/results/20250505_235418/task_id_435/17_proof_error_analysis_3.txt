Below is a step‐by‐step analysis of what’s going wrong in your proof and why Lean is upset:

──────────────────────────────
1. Which tactic is failing and why

The failure happens in the “second branch” of your conjunction proof. In your proof you write

  • exact Nat.mod_lt n 10 dec_trivial

to prove the goal

  n % 10 < 10

by using the lemma

  Nat.mod_lt : ∀ (a b : Nat) (h : 0 < b), a % b < b

that needs a proof that 0 < 10. In Lean 4 the lemma “Nat.mod_lt n 10 dec_trivial” is interpreted by trying to use dec_trivial as a term supplying the proof of (0 < 10). However, dec_trivial is typically a tactic (or tactic-like command) not a term that can be fed directly as an argument. Consequently, Lean does not “see” a complete proof for the inequality and complains that the goal is unsolved.

──────────────────────────────
2. Consider the proof state at that point

After you’ve unfolded definitions and simplified, your goal becomes a conjunction of two facts:
  • 0 ≤ n % 10
  • n % 10 < 10
After “apply And.intro” Lean generates two subgoals. The first one, 0 ≤ n % 10, is handled correctly by:

  exact Nat.zero_le (n % 10)

but the second subgoal, n % 10 < 10, is then attempted with

  exact Nat.mod_lt n 10 dec_trivial

At that moment, Lean is still missing the proper term for the proof of “0 < 10” — the hypothesis required by Nat.mod_lt. That is, Lean is expecting an explicit term of type (0 < 10).

──────────────────────────────
3. Check if the proof approach matches the specification

Your overall proof strategy is sound: you want to show that (n % 10) is in the interval [0, 10) and also equal to n % 10 by unfolding the specification. Decomposing the conjunction using And.intro is the usual technique. So nothing is wrong conceptually with the approach; the trouble is with providing the necessary piece of evidence (0 < 10).

──────────────────────────────
4. Identify any type mismatches or incorrect assumptions

The key issue is that Nat.mod_lt expects a proof of 0 < 10, but you are passing “dec_trivial” in that spot. In Lean 3 one sometimes sees dec_trivial used in such positions when it can compute a term; however, in Lean 4 dec_trivial is often best used as a tactic (or in “by decide” blocks) rather than a plain term. There is a type mismatch: Lean is not sure that “dec_trivial” here produces a term of type (0 < 10).

Also note the trailing error “unexpected identifier; expected command” is a symptom of the fact that after the unsolved goal the parser finds something unexpected (possibly due also to a bullet indentation issue).

──────────────────────────────
5. Consider alternative proof strategies

A couple of fixes are available:

(a) Provide an explicit proof that 0 < 10 as a term. For example, you can show that 0 < 10 by using “by decide” in a parenthesized term: 

  exact Nat.mod_lt n 10 (by decide)

or

(b) If you prefer to use dec_trivial, you can force it as a term by a similar tactic:

  exact Nat.mod_lt n 10 (dec_trivial : 0 < 10)

Another stylistic alternative is to replace “apply And.intro” with “constructor” (which automatically sets up a proof for an ∧) and then solve the subgoals.

──────────────────────────────
Conclusion & Direction for Fixing

The root cause of the error is that the lemma Nat.mod_lt requires a proof that 0 < 10 but you supplied “dec_trivial” where Lean expected a term of type 0 < 10. In Lean 4, dec_trivial is primarily a tactic rather than a term. To fix this, supply the necessary proof explicitly (for example, using (by decide) or a type annotation to convert dec_trivial into a term).

A fixed version of the second branch might look like:

 exact Nat.mod_lt n 10 (by decide)

With that change (and ensuring that the bullet indentation is correct), Lean should be happy with your proof.

This is the detailed diagnosis of the error.
