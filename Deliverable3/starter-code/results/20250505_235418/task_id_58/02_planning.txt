Below is my detailed reasoning process along with the resulting plan.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Understand the Function Specification

• The function, named hasOppositeSign, takes two integers, a and b.
• It must return true if one integer is strictly positive while the other is strictly negative.
• Note that if either integer is zero (or both), the function should yield false since zero’s sign is neither positive nor negative.

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Break Down into Subproblems

• We need to check two conditions:
  – Condition 1: a < 0 and b > 0.
  – Condition 2: a > 0 and b < 0.
• The overall result is given by the logical “or” (disjunction) of these two conditions.
• We can translate this into Lean's Boolean operations using the “&&” for “and” and “||” for “or.”

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. Consider Inputs, Edge Cases, and Expected Behavior

• The inputs are two integers (of type Int), so we use the built-in comparison operators.
• Edge case: If a or b is zero, then neither (a < 0 && b > 0) nor (a > 0 && b < 0) holds, and so the function correctly returns false.
• There is no need for further testing of boundaries because the simple comparisons capture all required scenarios.

──────────────────────────────
Step 4. Plan the Proof Strategy

• We must prove that the value returned by hasOppositeSign satisfies the specification expressed in hasOppositeSign_spec.
• In the specification, the left-hand side of the ↔ is exactly the same as the condition we used inside hasOppositeSign.
• Once we “unfold” or expand both definitions, the statement
  (a < 0 ∧ b > 0) ∨ (a > 0 ∧ b < 0)
 is directly identical to what is computed by our function.
• In Lean, after unfolding definitions, this equivalence is a direct “reflexivity” (i.e., by rfl) so the proof is trivial.

──────────────────────────────
Step 5. Note Similar Patterns

• Often in Lean, when definitions match up exactly, the proof can be finished with “rfl” (reflexivity).
• The structure of the function resembles many other examples where simple Boolean formulas are implemented.
• The proof strategy by “unfolding” the definitions is a common pattern.

──────────────────────────────
Final Detailed Plan

• Implementation:
 – Define hasOppositeSign such that it returns: (a < 0 && b > 0) || (a > 0 && b < 0).

• Proof:
 – Unfold the definitions of hasOppositeSign and hasOppositeSign_spec.
 – Notice that the condition (a < 0 ∧ b > 0) ∨ (a > 0 ∧ b < 0) appears on both sides of the equivalence.
 – Conclude with “rfl” to complete the proof.

Below is the complete Lean 4 code following the plan:

---------------------------------------------
import Mathlib
import Aesop

-- Implementation
def hasOppositeSign (a : Int) (b : Int) : Bool :=
  -- << CODE START >>
  (a < 0 && b > 0) || (a > 0 && b < 0)
  -- << CODE END >>

-- Theorem: The result is true if a and b have opposite signs
def hasOppositeSign_spec (a : Int) (b : Int) (result: Bool) : Prop :=
  -- << SPEC START >>
  ((a < 0 ∧ b > 0) ∨ (a > 0 ∧ b < 0)) ↔ result
  -- << SPEC END >>

theorem hasOppositeSign_spec_satisfied (a : Int) (b : Int) :
  hasOppositeSign_spec a b (hasOppositeSign a b) := by
  -- << PROOF START >>
  unfold hasOppositeSign hasOppositeSign_spec
  rfl
  -- << PROOF END >>
---------------------------------------------

This plan implements the required function and proves that its output agrees with the given specification.
