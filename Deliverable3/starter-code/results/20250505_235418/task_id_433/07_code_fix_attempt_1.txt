Below is our step-by-step analysis and the fixed version of the function:

─────────────────────────────  
Step 1. Identify the error source  
• The error is reported at the line  
  a.all? (fun x => n > x)  
• Lean complains that the environment does not contain the field “all?” on type Array.

─────────────────────────────  
Step 2. Explain why this is causing an issue  
• The method “all?” is being called on an Array, but Lean’s Array type (in the standard library and Mathlib) does not have a method with that name.  
• This causes a type error because Lean cannot find any declaration or field “all?” attached to Array Int.

─────────────────────────────  
Step 3. Consider the Lean type system and requirements  
• Lean’s Array type must be used with functions that are defined for it.  
• Although the idea is to check that every element of the array satisfies the predicate (n > x), Lean provides this functionality for List via List.all.  
• Since Array supports conversion to List via a.toList, we can leverage this conversion to use List.all.

─────────────────────────────  
Step 4. Think through potential solutions  
• One solution is to define our own “all?” function for arrays.  
• A simpler and effective solution is to use a.toList and then call List.all on it.  
• Hence, replacing a.all? with (a.toList).all will serve the intended purpose.

─────────────────────────────  
Step 5. Test each solution in your head  
• Converting the array to a list and then using List.all works:  
 – If the array is empty, List.all returns true (as expected).  
 – For a nonempty array, List.all correctly checks the predicate on every element.  
• The type of (a.toList).all (fun x => n > x) is Bool, matching the expected return type.

Fixed Implementation of the isGreater Function  

def isGreater (n : Int) (a : Array Int) : Bool :=
  (a.toList).all (fun x => n > x)
