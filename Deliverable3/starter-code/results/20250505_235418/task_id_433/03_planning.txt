Below is our complete plan with detailed explanation.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Understanding the Function

The problem is to write a Lean 4 function, isGreater, that takes an integer n and an array a of integers and returns true exactly when “n is strictly greater than every element of a.” In other words, we want:

  result = true ⟺ (∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!).

That is, if even one element of a is greater than or equal to n, the function should return false.

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Breakdown into Subproblems

A. Implementation:  
 1. We must iterate over all elements of the array a.  
 2. Check that for every element x the predicate n > x holds.  
 3. Return true if and only if n is greater than every element.

There are at least two natural ways to do this:
 • Use a built-in higher‐order function such as Array.all? (if available).
 • Write a recursive/iterative function (or use foldl) that “and”s together the test for each element.

B. Specification Proof:  
We wish to prove the theorem isGreater_spec_satisfied. That is, we want to show:
  (∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!) ↔ isGreater n a.

This proof essentially shows that our implementation exactly captures the intended semantics. The two directions are:

 (⇒) If every element satisfies n > a[i]!, then isGreater returns true.  
 (⇐) If isGreater returns true, then every element satisfies n > a[i]!  
A common approach is to use a lemma about Array.all? which establishes that “a.all? p = true” is equivalent to “∀ i, i < a.size → p (a[i]!)” (or “∀ x ∈ a, p x”).

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. Consideration of Input Types, Edge Cases, and Expected Behavior

• The input n is an integer and a is an array of integers.  
• Edge Case: The array could be empty. In that case, the empty universal property holds vacuously and the function should return true.  
• In nonempty cases, the function must check every element.  
• The implementation must not crash on any input (and the problem tells us a is non-null).

──────────────────────────────
Step 4. Proof Techniques to Consider

For the correctness proof of isGreater_spec_satisfied, we can use:
 • Unfolding the definitions of isGreater and isGreater_spec.
 • A lemma (or an induction) on arrays that relates “a.all? p = true” with ∀ i, i < a.size → p (a[i]!).

If Lean’s Mathlib already provides a suitable lemma (for instance, something like Array.all?_forall or Array.forall_iff), we can use that. If not, a short induction over the array indices (or on the structure of the array) would suffice.

──────────────────────────────
Step 5. Similar Patterns and Hints from Documentation

In the provided examples, you may have seen how replicate (or recursive functions) are defined and how the conversion of a recursive function to a “fold-like” form works. Similarly, using Array.all?, you “fold” the property over all elements. In many functional programming libraries the Boolean function “all” is defined by:
  all p [] = true  
  all p (x :: xs) = p x ∧ all p xs

Thus, the equivalence ∀ x in the list, p x, corresponds exactly to all p list = true.

You can apply the same reasoning here using Lean’s Array abstraction.

──────────────────────────────
Overall Plan

Implementation Plan:
1. Use the built-in function Array.all? to check the predicate for every element.
  Definition: def isGreater (n : Int) (a : Array Int) : Bool :=
    a.all? (fun x => n > x)
  This definition naturally returns true for an empty array (vacuous truth) and returns true if and only if every element satisfies n > x.

Proof Plan:
1. Unfold the definitions of isGreater and isGreater_spec.
2. Reduce the goal to showing:
  (∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!) ↔ a.all? (fun x => n > x)
3. Either invoke a library lemma (if available) that says exactly this equivalence or prove it by induction on the length of a.
  • Base: For a.empty, show that both sides are true.
  • Inductive step: Assume the equivalence holds for an array a of length k. For an array of length k+1 (obtained by appending one element y), we show:
    ((∀ i, i < (a.push y).size → n > (a.push y)[i]!) ↔ (a.all? (fun x => n > x) && n > y))
  Using the definition of Array.all? (or using a fold), this step is straightforward.
4. Conclude that the specification is met by our function.

Final Template with Detailed Plan Comments

Below is the Lean template (with our comments in the {{code}}/{{proof}} markers replaced by our planned code and proofs):

------------------------------------------------------------
import Mathlib
import Aesop

-- Implementation
def isGreater (n : Int) (a : Array Int) : Bool :=
  -- We use the built-in Array.all? that returns true exactly when
  -- every element x in the array satisfies the predicate.
  a.all? (fun x => n > x)


-- Theorem: If the result is true, then n is greater than all elements in the array;
-- If the result is false, then there exists at least one element in the array 
-- that is greater than or equal to n.
def isGreater_spec (n : Int) (a : Array Int) (result : Bool) : Prop :=
  (∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!) ↔ result

theorem isGreater_spec_satisfied (n : Int) (a : Array Int) :
  isGreater_spec n a (isGreater n a) := by
  -- We unfold the definition of isGreater and isGreater_spec.
  unfold isGreater isGreater_spec
  -- Now our goal becomes proving:
  -- (∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!) ↔ a.all? (λ x, n > x)
  --
  -- At this point one can use an existing library lemma that relates Array.all? with the
  -- universal property over an array. For example, if Mathlib provided “Array.all?_forall”,
  -- one could write:
  --
  -- exact Array.all?_iff (fun x => n > x) a
  --
  -- In the absence of such a lemma, we proceed by a simple argument (by induction on a.size).
  --
  -- [Proof Sketch:]
  -- • For an empty array, both sides are trivially true.
  -- • For a non-empty array, unfolding the definition of all? shows that:
  --      a.all? (λ x, n > x) = (n > head) && (tail.all? (λ x, n > x)),
  --   while
  --      (∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!) splits into:
  --         n > head ∧ (∀ i, i < tail.size → n > tail[i]!).
  -- Using the induction hypothesis, these two are equivalent.
  --
  -- For brevity in this script, we assume the lemma Array.all?_iff is available.
  --
  -- [If a lemma is not available, one may complete the proof along the lines of the above sketch.]
  --
  -- Here we invoke the lemma (or mimic its effect):
  sorry  -- Replace sorry with the detailed induction proof as needed.

Conclusion

We have broken down the problem into two main parts:
 1. The implementation of isGreater using Array.all? to capture the notion that n is greater than every element in a.
 2. The proof, by unfolding definitions and using either an existing lemma or an induction argument, shows that our implementation meets the specification—that is,
  (∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!) ↔ isGreater n a.

This plan explains how we attack the problem step-by-step; the actual Lean proof may either refer to a library lemma (if available) or carry out the inductive argument.
