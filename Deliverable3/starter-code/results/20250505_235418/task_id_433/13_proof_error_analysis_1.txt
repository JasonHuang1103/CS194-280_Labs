Below is an explanation that walks through the error step‐by‐step. (Note that nothing is “wrong” with Lean’s type-checker; rather, the proof script tries to use a lemma and tactics in a way that does not match the goal’s shape.)

──────────────────────────── Step 1: Which tactic is failing and why? 

The error message

  ⊢ (∀ i < a.size, a[i]! < n) ↔ ∀ (i : ℕ) (x : i < a.size), a[i]! < n

indicates that after unfolding and simp, our goal is an equivalence between two versions of a “for all” statement. We then do

  intro h  
  apply List.all_all

The problem is that we are “introducing a hypothesis” (using intro) even though the goal is an equivalence (a statement of the form P ↔ Q). In a proof of an equivalence you typically want to use tactics like split or apply iff.intro so you can prove the two directions separately. Instead, writing “intro h” (which is normally used to introduce an assumption in an implication) messes up the structure of the goal. In other words, the tactic chain “intro h; apply List.all_all” makes no sense in this context.

──────────────────────────── Step 2: Examine the proof state

After unfolding definitions and running simp, the goal is transformed into proving

  (∀ i, i < a.size → a[i]! < n) ↔ (∀ (i : ℕ) (x : i < a.size), a[i]! < n).

Even though these are “logically equivalent” (because (i < a.size → …) is equivalent to (∀ (x : i < a.size) …)), Lean does not “see” these as definitionally equal, so you must show explicitly that the two formulations are equivalent. The “List.all_all” lemma is intended to bridge the gap between the list version of “all” (with one style of quantification) and the other, but our goal did not land exactly where that lemma is applicable.

──────────────────────────── Step 3: Check if the proof approach matches the specification

The specification says that

  isGreater_spec n a result : Prop := ∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]! ↔ result

and the definition of isGreater is based on calling List.all on a.toList. In the proof we are attempting to prove that

  ∀ i, i < a.size → n > a[i]!

is equivalent to what List.all produces, but after simp the inequality “n > a[i]!” becomes “a[i]! < n.” That is perfectly fine mathematically, but our tactic “intro h” and then “apply List.all_all” assume a different “shape” of the goal. In many cases one would split the equivalence and use a lemma like List.all_iff_forall (or its variants) on a.toList rather than trying to introduce a hypothesis “h” out of an equivalence.

──────────────────────────── Step 4: Identify any type mismatches or incorrect assumptions

There are two issues here:
1. The ordering of the inequality: The expression “n > a[i]!” is definitionally the same as “a[i]! < n” (since “>” is defined as the flipped “<”), but after simp the goal’s order is “a[i]! < n” even though our original specification writes “n > a[i]!”; this isn’t a “mismatch” per se but makes the tactic choice (namely, using List.all_all) even more delicate.
2. The way the universal quantifiers are written: The goal is
  ∀ i, i < a.size → a[i]! < n
whereas the lemma might expect
  ∀ (i : ℕ) (h : i < a.size), a[i]! < n.
They are logically equivalent but differ in the way the assumptions are “packaged.” Lean does not immediately see them as identical. Our proof does not address this conversion properly.

──────────────────────────── Step 5: Consider alternative proof strategies

To fix the problem one might:
• Avoid using “intro” on an equivalence. Instead, use a tactic like
  apply Iff.intro
or
  split
and prove each direction separately.
• Rewrite the goal in a way that acknowledges the fact that (i < a.size → …) is equivalent to (∀ (x : i < a.size) …). One standard way is to use an existing lemma such as “List.all_iff_forall” on a.toList.
• Alternatively, one might show that the two formulations of “all” are equivalent by unfolding the definition of “all” (which is done on a.toList) and then showing by extensionality that the two “for all” formulations are the same.

──────────────────────────── Conclusion

The root cause of the error is that our proof mistakenly “introduces” a hypothesis into a goal that is an equivalence, and then applies the lemma List.all_all in a context where the two forms of universal quantification (using an arrow versus using an explicit proof argument) are not immediately identified as equivalent. In short, we have a tactic mismatch: we try to use “intro h” when we should be splitting the equivalence and then properly applying the known list lemma to relate the Array version (produced by a.toList.all) to its equivalent “for all” statement.

A good direction to fix this would be:
• Replace “intro h” by “split” (or “apply Iff.intro”) so that you handle both directions.
• Use a lemma such as List.all_iff_forall on (a.toList) to connect the definition of isGreater with the specification.
• In general, ensure that the quantifier style (i.e. (i < a.size → …) vs. ∀ (x : i < a.size) …) is made explicit and handled properly.

This analysis should help you adjust the proof so that the tactics match the goal, and the conversion between the two “all” formulations is made explicit.
