Below is our step‐by‐step reasoning process and the accompanying detailed plan for both the Lean function implementation and its correctness proof.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Understand the Problem

• The function must check whether a given integer n is divisible by 11.
• “Divisible by 11” means that n % 11 = 0.
• Accordingly, our function should return true when n % 11 = 0 and false otherwise.

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Break Down into Subproblems

a. Implementation:
   – We need to implement isDivisibleBy11 so that it checks if n % 11 = 0.
   – In Lean, a natural way is to use an if-then-else construct:
       if n % 11 = 0 then true else false.
   – Note: In Lean the modulo operator (%) is defined for Int and returns the remainder.
   
b. Specification:
   – The specification predicate is given by:
       n % 11 = 0 ↔ result.
   – That is, if result is the output of our function, then the equivalence n % 11 = 0 is true exactly when result = true.

c. Proof:
   – We need to prove that for every integer n, the function’s output (computed with our implementation) satisfies the specification.
   – When we unfold the definitions, we obtain:
         n % 11 = 0 ↔ (if n % 11 = 0 then true else false).
   – This equivalence is immediate. The proof can be done by a case split on the condition (n % 11 = 0).

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. Consider Input Types, Edge Cases, and Expected Behavior

• Input type is Int. Lean’s Int type handles both positive and negative numbers.
• The modulo operation works similarly for negative numbers as well (keeping in mind Lean’s definition of %).
• No additional edge cases are needed because the function is simply checking the equality n % 11 = 0.

──────────────────────────────
Step 4. Choose Appropriate Proof Techniques

• The proof uses a simple unfolding (or simplification) strategy:
   – Unfold the definitions of isDivisibleBy11 and isDivisibleBy11_spec.
   – Then, perform a case analysis on the condition (n % 11 = 0) using the if-then-else structure.
• The proof is essentially a direct equivalence by definition.

──────────────────────────────
Step 5. Identify Similar Patterns

• A common pattern in Lean proofs is proving that:
      P ↔ (if P then true else false)
  which is true by a simple case split.
• The manual cases:
    o When n % 11 = 0, then the if branch returns true, so the equivalence becomes (true ↔ true).
    o When n % 11 ≠ 0, then the if branch returns false, so the equivalence becomes (false ↔ false).

──────────────────────────────
Detailed Implementation and Proof Plan

1. Implementation:
   – Write the isDivisibleBy11 function using:
         def isDivisibleBy11 (n : Int) : Bool := if n % 11 = 0 then true else false

2. Proof:
   – State the theorem isDivisibleBy11_spec_satisfied.
   – Unfold the definitions using the "unfold" tactic.
   – Do a case analysis using "split" or "by_cases" on the condition n % 11 = 0.
   – Handle each branch (the if and else) to show that the equivalence holds.
   – Lean’s simplifier is likely smart enough that after unfolding the definitions, the result is evident.

The Completed Lean Code

Below is the final code based on our plan:

-------------------------------------------------
import Mathlib
import Aesop

-- Implementation
def isDivisibleBy11 (n : Int) : Bool :=
  -- << CODE START >>
  if n % 11 = 0 then true else false
  -- << CODE END >>

-- Specification: The result is true if n is divisible by 11, false otherwise.
def isDivisibleBy11_spec (n : Int) (result : Bool) : Prop :=
  -- << SPEC START >>
  n % 11 = 0 ↔ result
  -- << SPEC END >>

theorem isDivisibleBy11_spec_satisfied (n : Int) :
  isDivisibleBy11_spec n (isDivisibleBy11 n) :=
by
  -- << PROOF START >>
  unfold isDivisibleBy11 isDivisibleBy11_spec
  by_cases h: n % 11 = 0
  · -- Case: n % 11 = 0
    simp [h]  -- Here the if expression becomes "if true then true else false" which reduces to true.
  · -- Case: n % 11 ≠ 0
    simp [h]  -- Here the if becomes "if false then true else false" which reduces to false.
  -- << PROOF END >>
