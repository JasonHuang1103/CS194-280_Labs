Below is a step‐by‐step analysis of what’s going wrong and why Lean complains:

──────────────────────────────
1. Failing tactic and its cause

• In your proof you write

  apply And.intro  
  · rfl  
  · intro i hi  
   simp [Array.map]

After “apply And.intro” Lean splits the goal into two subgoals:
 (a) Prove (Array.map (λ x => x * x * x) a).size = a.size  
 (b) Prove ∀ i < a.size, (Array.map (λ x => x * x * x) a)[i]! = a[i]! * a[i]! * a[i]!

The tactic “rfl” is used to close the first subgoal. However, this equality is not “by definition” (i.e. not definitionally equal) so rfl does not work. (Likewise, simp [Array.map] does not completely solve the second goal.)  
Moreover, the error “unexpected token '·'; expected command” appears because Lean’s bullet notation is very sensitive to layout and the fact that some goals remain unsolved (or the bullets aren’t parsed if the expected command is missing).

──────────────────────────────
2. The proof state at that point

After “apply And.intro” the state is as follows:

• Goal 1:  
  (Array.map (λ x => x * x * x) a).size = a.size

• Goal 2:  
  ∀ i < a.size, (Array.map (λ x => x * x * x) a)[i]! = a[i]! * a[i]! * a[i]!

The “rfl” tactic does not immediately match the left-hand side to the right-hand side in Goal 1 because the underlying definition of Array.map is not unfolded enough (or its size behavior is not definitionally equal to a.size). Similarly, “simp [Array.map]” is not strong enough to completely finish Goal 2.

──────────────────────────────
3. How the proof approach relates to the specification

Your specification cubeElements_spec clearly expresses two properties:
 – That the array sizes are equal
 – That each element in the result is the cube of the corresponding element

Your proof splits these using And.intro. That is a reasonable approach. However, the tactic choices (rfl and simp [Array.map]) do not supply the necessary lemmas about arrays (e.g. about map preserving the size or about the behavior of the index operation) to match the specification.

──────────────────────────────
4. Type mismatches or incorrect assumptions

No type mismatches occur here per se; the both sides of the equalities have the same types. Instead, the issue is that you are assuming that unfolding or simplifying Array.map gives you a definitionally equal result. In reality, the definition of Array.map does not reduce to a form where (result.size) is literally a.size. (There is an underlying lemma along the lines of Array.map_size that you must apply.) Similarly, when reasoning about the element-by-element equality, you must likely either use a lemma or further unfold the definition rather than just use simp.

──────────────────────────────
5. Alternative proof strategies

• Instead of using rfl, you can use or apply a known lemma like Array.size_map (if available) or show the equality by rewriting with the proper unfolding.
• For the second goal, consider invoking the appropriate lemmas about Array.map—for example, rewriting the goal with an array-indexing lemma that tells you how indexes behave after a map.
• You might also try using the “constructor” tactic instead of And.intro and then separately invoking tactics that call the appropriate rewriting rules.
• Finally, check your bullet indentation (the “·” notation). Sometimes if Lean’s goal isn’t solved completely the bullet may be misinterpreted. You can work “one goal at a time” by leaving the subgoals and proving them one by one (or by using “guard_target” to see what the goal expects).

Detailed Analysis & Recommended Fix Direction

The root cause is that the current tactics (rfl for the size equality and simp [Array.map] for the element property) do not “see” the equalities you want to prove. They do not reduce the map operation into the form that clearly shows that the size remains untouched or that each element is transformed as desired. Moreover, the unsolved goals cause the bullet “·” tokens to be flagged as unexpected later on because Lean is expecting a full command for each goal.

To fix the proof, you should:

1. Replace rfl with a tactic that uses the known property/lemma that “map” preserves the size. For example, if Mathlib provides a lemma like Array.map_size, then use rewrite or exact that lemma.
2. For the second goal, similarly use an appropriate lemma or further unfold Array.map so that the equality becomes straightforward.
3. Ensure proper bullet indentation. Sometimes switching to “constructor” or tackling each goal in a separate “begin … end” block helps.

A revised approach might look like:

 theorem cubeElements_spec_satisfied (a : Array Int) :
  cubeElements_spec a (cubeElements a) := by
  unfold cubeElements cubeElements_spec
  constructor
   -- For the size equality, use a known lemma instead of rfl
   apply Array.map_size
  constructor
   intro i hi
   -- Use an unfolding or rewriting lemma about Array.map’s effect on indexing
   rw [Array.get_map]  -- (if such a lemma exists)
   rfl

(Of course, the names of the lemmas might differ. Check the Mathlib documentation on Array operations for the right ones.)

──────────────────────────────
Conclusion

The error comes from two issues:
 • The tactics used to close the two subgoals (rfl and simp [Array.map]) do not actually close them because Lean’s definitions of Array.map and size are not reducible to the expected equalities.
 • The bullet “·” token then appears unexpectedly because there are unsolved goals and potentially an indentation or parsing problem.

The solution is to use the appropriate lemmas (for instance, one that states that Array.map preserves size and one that relates the indexing of Array.map’s result to that of the original array) to finish each subgoal. This will eliminate the unsolved goals and resolve the unexpected token error.

By reading the relevant parts of the Lean 4 documentation and Mathlib’s API for Array, you should be able to find or prove the needed lemmas to finish the proof.
