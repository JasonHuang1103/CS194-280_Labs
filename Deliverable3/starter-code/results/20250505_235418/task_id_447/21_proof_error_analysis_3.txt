Below is a step‐by‐step analysis of the error you are seeing.

──────────────────────────────
1. Identify which tactic is failing and why

• Your proof begins with

  unfold cubeElements cubeElements_spec  
  apply And.intro

This “apply And.intro” creates two subgoals:
 – One for the left conjunct: (cubeElements a).size = a.size
 – One for the right conjunct: ∀ i, i < a.size → (cubeElements a)[i]! = (a[i]! * a[i]! * a[i]!)

• Immediately after “apply And.intro” you use the bullet tokens “·” (one for each subgoal):

  · exact Array.size_map a (λ x => x * x * x)
  · intro i hi
    exact Array.get_map _ _ i

However, the error message says:

  error: unexpected token '·'; expected command

This tells us that Lean did not expect the bullet tokens at this point. In Lean 4 the bullet syntax has strict parsing (and indenting) requirements, and if it isn’t used exactly right then Lean may not treat the “·” as delimiters for subproofs. As a result the tactics that were intended to solve the subgoals are not actually executed, leaving the goals unsolved.

──────────────────────────────
2. Consider the proof state at that point

At the moment of “apply And.intro”, your proof state becomes two unsolved goals:  

 Goal 1: (Array.map (λ x => x*x*x) a).size = a.size  
 Goal 2: ∀ i, i < a.size → (Array.map (λ x => x*x*x) a)[i]! = (a[i]! * a[i]! * a[i]!)

The plan is then to solve goal #1 using the lemma Array.size_map, and goal #2 using Array.get_map. However, because the bullets are “unexpected” (or mis-indented), Lean never actually processes the intended tactic commands.

──────────────────────────────
3. Check if the proof approach matches the specification

Your overall strategy is correct. You want to show that mapping the function to cube each element preserves the array length (using Array.size_map) and that each index picks up the result of cubing (using Array.get_map). Algebraically and logically, the approach exactly matches the specification given by cubeElements_spec.

──────────────────────────────
4. Identify any type mismatches or incorrect assumptions

There is no type mismatch in the mathematical part of the proof. Both Array.size_map and Array.get_map have the correct types when called with the function (λ x => x * x * x) and array a. The error is not about the mathematical content or any hidden assumptions; it is a syntactic/parsing problem with the bullet tokens.

──────────────────────────────
5. Consider alternative proof strategies

There are two main avenues to fix this:
 • Fix the bullet syntax. In Lean 4, bullet tokens (like “·”) must be used with proper indenting. One way to resolve it is to ensure that each bullet is indented further than the “apply And.intro” line and is in its own correct block.
 • Alternatively, you can opt not to use bullets at all. For example, you could structure the proof with a begin … end block and chain the tactics appropriately. For example:

  theorem cubeElements_spec_satisfied (a : Array Int) :
   cubeElements_spec a (cubeElements a) := by
   unfold cubeElements cubeElements_spec
   apply And.intro
     exact Array.size_map a (λ x => x * x * x)
   intro i hi
     exact Array.get_map (λ x => x * x * x) a i

Note that in the second subgoal I also made the lambda explicit in Array.get_map to help Lean figure out the arguments. (Sometimes underscores work, but giving the function explicitly can avoid inference issues.)

Conclusion and Root Cause

The root cause of your error is not in your mathematical specification or in your use of Array.size_map or Array.get_map. Rather, it is a syntactic issue: Lean does not expect the bullet “·” tokens where they appear. This is likely because the bullets were not correctly indented (or the tactic block wasn’t set up appropriately), so Lean couldn’t parse your subproofs. 

To fix the issue, try reformatting your proof so that the bullet tokens are correctly placed or use an alternative structuring method (for example, by using a proper begin … end block with aligned tactics). This will allow Lean to recognize the two subgoal proofs (one solving the left conjunct and one for the right), and thus your theorem will be fully proved.
