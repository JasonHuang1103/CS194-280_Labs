Below is our step-by-step reasoning and detailed plan for both the implementation and the proof.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Function Understanding

• The function cubeElements must take an array of integers (which could be empty) and return a new array of the same length.
• For every element x in the input array a, the corresponding element in the output should be x * x * x (the cube of x).

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Breaking Down the Problem

A. Implementation Subproblem:
   1. We need to transform every element of the array a.
   2. Lean’s Array type provides a map method. Using a.map (λ x, x * x * x) will automatically produce an array of the same length where each element has been cubed.
   
B. Proof Subproblem:
   1. We have the specification cubeElements_spec which includes two parts:
      a. That the size (length) of the output array equals the size of the input.
      b. That for every valid index i (i < a.size), the i-th element of the output array equals the cube of the i-th element of the input.
      
   2. For the proof, Lean’s Array library provides useful lemmas:
      • A lemma similar to Array.size_map shows that mapping a function over an array preserves its length.
      • A lemma such as Array.get_map indicates that for any i < a.size, (a.map f)[i]! = f (a[i]!).
      
   3. Therefore, we plan to invoke these properties or (if not built-in) follow their proofs by unfolding the definitions.

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. Consider Input Types, Edge Cases, and Expected Behavior

• The input a is an Array Int. Even if it is empty, map will result in an empty array. The length is preserved.
• There is no need to worry about integer overflow here as the specification does not state such behavior.
• All elements of the array will be processed by the same cubic function.

──────────────────────────────
Step 4. Appropriate Proof Techniques

• Tactic style (using commands like unfold, split, intro, and exact).
• We’ll split the proof into two parts (proving the size equality and the element-wise cube equation).
• For each index i, after using intros and the assumption that i < a.size, we use the fact that Array.get_map holds: (a.map f)[i]! = f (a[i]!).

──────────────────────────────
Step 5. Similar Patterns and Examples

• We note that the use of array.map in Lean is analogous to functions in other languages that transform every element of an array.
• The standard tactic “split” will let us split the conjunction in the specification.
• The "intro" tactic and then applying known lemmas (or doing a case analysis on the structure of Array.map) will enable us to conclude the proof of the element-wise property.

──────────────────────────────
Detailed Plan for Implementation and Proof

1. Implementation:
   • We define cubeElements using Array.map:
     
       def cubeElements (a : Array Int) : Array Int :=
         a.map (λ x, x * x * x)
         
   This directly applies the transformation to each element.

2. Proof Strategy:
   • Start with:
     
       theorem cubeElements_spec_satisfied (a : Array Int) :
         cubeElements_spec a (cubeElements a) := by
         unfold cubeElements cubeElements_spec
         
   • Split the goal into two parts:
       (i) Showing (cubeElements a).size = a.size.
       (ii) Showing that for every index i such that i < a.size, (cubeElements a)[i]! = a[i]! * a[i]! * a[i]!.
     
   • For (i), we use the property that map preserves the size.
   • For (ii), assume any arbitrary index i with the hypothesis i < a.size.
       Then use the property of Array.map (e.g., Array.get_map) which tells us:
             (a.map (λ x, x * x * x))[i]! = (λ x, x * x * x) (a[i]!) 
         and then by definition this equals a[i]! * a[i]! * a[i]!.

Conclusion

We have:
1. Implemented cubeElements using Array.map to cube every element.
2. Proved that cubeElements_spec is satisfied by showing that the mapped array has the same size as the input array, and that every element is cubed as required.

This step-by-step plan correctly implements the function and provides a clear and concise proof using Lean’s tactic style.
