Below is a step‐by‐step analysis of what’s going wrong in the proof and what the root cause is.

──────────────────────────────
1. Which tactic is failing and why

The error message 
  “⊢ ∀ i < a.size, (Array.map (fun x => x * x * x) a)[i]! = a[i]! * a[i]! * a[i]!”
shows that after unfolding and using simp, the proof still has a remaining subgoal about element‐wise equality. In other words, the simp tactic (or the unfolding) does not simplify the goal to something trivial.
In addition, after that the proof contains “apply And.intro” and then bullet “· rfl” etc. The error message “unexpected identifier; expected command” points to a problem with the tactic block indentation and/or control flow – essentially Lean sees an unsolved goal before the bullet begins. So the failing “tactic” is the use of simp (or the overall proof structure) because it does not discharge the second conjunct of the specification; the goal is left “unsolved” and subsequent commands (and bullet markers) then produce an error.

2. What is the proof state at that point

After executing
  unfold cubeElements cubeElements_spec
  simp
we are left with two subgoals:
 • First, to show that (Array.map (λ x, x*x*x) a).size = a.size.
 • Second, to show that ∀ i, i < a.size → (Array.map (λ x, x*x*x) a)[i]! = a[i]! * a[i]! * a[i]!.
The first goal is trivial (solved by rfl) and that’s why the proof later uses “· rfl.”
The second goal, however, is not automatically simplified by simp. There is no known simp lemma in the imported libraries that tells Lean that mapping a “cube” function makes every element be cubed in the array‐lookup. As a result, the goal remains unsolved when we try to proceed with the bullet for the second part.

──────────────────────────────
3. Does the proof approach match the specification?

Yes, the general idea of splitting the conjunction using And.intro is exactly the right approach. You want to show:
 (a.map cube).size = a.size  and  ∀ i, i < a.size → (a.map cube)[i]! = a[i]!³.
However, Lean does not “know” automatically that Array.map preserves the i‑th element behavior by using simp alone. You may need to invoke (or prove) a specific lemma about Array.map (for example, a lemma like Array.map_nth if available) to handle the element‐wise equality.

──────────────────────────────
4. Identify any type mismatches or incorrect assumptions

There is no fundamental type mismatch here. The specification is stated using the “!” (bang) operator for Array indexing, which unwraps an option. (In Mathlib  or core Lean, the Array library contains such functions.) Still, the issue is not about types but a “missing computation” – the simp step does not convert the mapping and the index lookup into the expected arithmetic computation.
Also note that the unusual error “unexpected identifier; expected command” comes from the fact that the tactic block is not “closed” properly – Lean still has unsolved goals when you try to apply further tactics.

──────────────────────────────
5. Consider alternative proof strategies

Here are a couple of directions you might take:
 • Prove (or import) a lemma about Array.map and indexing. For example, if there is a lemma such as “Array.map_nth : ∀ (f : α → β) (a : Array α) (i), i < a.size → (a.map f)[i]! = f (a[i]!)”, then you can simply invoke this lemma.
 • Alternatively, you might perform an induction on the array’s structure and prove the property mutation by mutation.
 • Lastly, if you’re using Aesop or other automation, you might give more hints so that the element‐wise equality gets solved automatically.

Detailed Analysis of the Root Cause and a Fix Direction

The root cause is that after unfolding the definitions and simplifying, the element‐wise goal
  ∀ i, i < a.size → (Array.map (λ x => x*x*x) a)[i]! = a[i]! * a[i]! * a[i]!
remains “unsolved” because Lean does not have a simp rule (or an automatic reduction) for Array.map’s behavior under Array.index! (the “bang” notation). That unsolved goal then makes the following “apply And.intro” and bullet steps cause an “unexpected identifier” error when Lean expects all the goals to be handled.

To fix this you can:

 • Either add a lemma or rewrite rule for Array.map’s nth (or !‐) operation, for example:
  lemma cubeElements_nth (a : Array Int) (i : Nat) (hi : i < a.size) :
   (cubeElements a)[i]! = (a[i]! * a[i]! * a[i]!) :=
  by rw [cubeElements, Array.map_nth _ _ hi] -- or prove it directly

 • Then you can use that lemma in your proof to finish the second subgoal.
 • Alternatively, modify your tactic proofs to handle the element‐wise case by replacing “simp” with a more targeted tactic or combination of tactics that would reduce the left‐hand side to the right one.

In summary, the error comes from a subgoal that is left unsolved because the automated simplification isn’t strong enough to handle the Array.map indexing. Correcting it will involve providing either the missing lemma or adapting your proof strategy (or both) so that the equality can be deduced.

Happy proving!
