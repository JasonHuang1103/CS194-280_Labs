Below is my step-by-step analysis:

1. Identify the specific part of the code causing the error:
  The error occurs in the lambda expression within the function cubeElements. In the line
    a.map (λ x, x * x * x)
  the comma after “λ x” is not expected.

2. Explain why this is causing an issue:
  In Lean 4, lambda expressions must separate the argument(s) and the body using “=>” (or the Unicode arrow “↦”), not a comma. The syntax “λ x, …” is no longer accepted. The parser sees the comma and complains that it expected “=>” instead.

3. Consider the type system and Lean 4 requirements:
  Though the type of x (here an Int) is fine, the lambda syntax change in Lean 4 means that developers should now use “λ x => …” (or “fun x => …”) to properly construct a function.

4. Think through potential solutions:
  Replace the comma with “=>” so that the lambda correctly reads “λ x => x * x * x”. This adheres to Lean 4’s expected syntax for lambdas.

5. Test each solution in your head:
  By rewriting the expression as
    a.map (λ x => x * x * x)
  the lambda is now correctly formed. Alternatively, using “fun” as in “fun x => x * x * x” would also work correctly in Lean 4.

Based on the reasoning, here’s the fixed version of the function implementation:

-------------------------------------------------
def cubeElements (a : Array Int) : Array Int :=
  a.map (λ x => x * x * x)
-------------------------------------------------
