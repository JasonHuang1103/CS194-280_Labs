Below is a detailed walkthrough of the thought process leading to the solution, followed by the final plan for implementation and proof.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1: Understanding What the Function Should Do

• The description asks for a Lean 4 function that multiplies two integers.
• The function’s signature is def multiply (a : Int) (b : Int) : Int. Therefore, its sole purpose is to compute and return a * b.
• The specification property multiply_spec is defined as result = a * b.

──────────────────────────────
Step 2: Breaking Down the Problem

• There are two parts:
  1. Implement the function “multiply” so that it returns a * b.
  2. Prove the theorem “multiply_spec_satisfied” stating that the function’s result meets the specification.
  
• Since multiplication in Lean on integers (Int) is already defined with the operator *, our task is to simply call that operator.

──────────────────────────────
Step 3: Considering Input Types, Edge Cases, and Expected Behavior

• Both a and b are of type Int and can be negative, zero, or positive.
• The built-in multiplication operator (*) on integers handles all these cases correctly.
• Therefore, there isn’t any exceptional edge case that needs special handling. We can rely on the properties of the built-in operator.

──────────────────────────────
Step 4: Choosing an Appropriate Proof Technique

• The specification property, multiply_spec, is defined as “result = a * b”. Since our implementation directly returns a * b, the theorem is true by definition.
• A straightforward proof strategy is to “unfold” the definitions of multiply and multiply_spec so that both sides of the equality become identical. 
• Finally, the “rfl” (reflexivity) tactic can be used since both sides are definitionally equal.

──────────────────────────────
Step 5: Noting Similar Patterns from Examples

• In similar examples involving simple arithmetic functions, the pattern is to directly define the function using existing operators and then prove the theorem by unfolding definitions and using reflexivity.
• This pattern confirms that a simple structural proof is sufficient.

Final Detailed Plan for Implementation and Proof

1. Implementation:
   - Define the function multiply such that it returns a * b.
   - This is done by simply writing: def multiply (a : Int) (b : Int) : Int := a * b.

2. Proof:
   - In the theorem multiply_spec_satisfied, unfold the definitions of multiply and multiply_spec.
   - After unfolding, the goal should be “a * b = a * b”, which is immediately true by reflexivity.
   - Use the “rfl” tactic to conclude the proof.
