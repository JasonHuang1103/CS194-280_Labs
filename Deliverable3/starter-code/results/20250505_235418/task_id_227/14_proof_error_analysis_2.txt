Below is a step‐by‐step discussion of what is going wrong in your proof and why Lean is complaining.

–––– Step 1. Which tactic is “failing” and why? ––––
The error message shows two problems. First, in the branch when the “if‐guard” holds (the so‐called “if_pos” branch) you use

  exact h

when you are trying to prove that a ≤ b and that a ≤ c. But h has type “a ≤ min b c” (i.e. a is below the minimum of b and c) and does not by itself supply a proof that a ≤ b (or a ≤ c). In other words, you must “bridge” from a ≤ min b c to a ≤ b using a transitivity argument (namely, by using the fact that min b c ≤ b).

The second message

  error: unexpected token '·'; expected command

often indicates a problem with using the bullet (·) notation. In Lean (and particularly in Lean 4) the use of bullets requires careful indentation so that Lean knows exactly which goal you are addressing. In your file the bullets are causing Lean to see “unsolved goals” and also a parsing error (“unexpected token '·'”) because the structure of the subproofs is not exactly what Lean expects.

–––– Step 2. What is the proof state at that point? ––––
After you “unfold” the definitions and do a case analysis (with by_cases h : a ≤ min b c), you get two cases:

• In the “if_pos” branch (where a ≤ min b c holds) the goal becomes
  ((a ≤ a ∧ a ≤ b ∧ a ≤ c) ∧ (a = a ∨ a = b ∨ a = c))
because the “if” expression reduces (via rw if_pos h) to a. The first conjunct a ≤ a is trivial (by reflexivity), but to prove a ≤ b you must show:
  a ≤ min b c and min b c ≤ b
and similarly for a ≤ c.

• In the “if_neg” branch (where ¬ (a ≤ min b c) holds) after rewriting (rw if_neg h) you need to show that
  (min b c ≤ a ∧ min b c ≤ b ∧ min b c ≤ c) ∧ (min b c = a ∨ min b c = b ∨ min b c = c).
Here the inequalities for b and c are provided by the standard lemmas (min_le_left and min_le_right), but the a–inequality must be handled by “inverting” the condition ¬ (a ≤ min b c).

In both cases the goal is a conjunction with several parts, and the “split” tactic is used. However, some of the subgoals are not discharged because you used “exact h” where you needed a transitivity step (and perhaps the bullets were not nested as required), so Lean ends up with unsolved goals.

–––– Step 3. Does the proof approach match the specification? ––––
Your intended approach is correct in spirit. You want to reason by cases depending on whether a ≤ min b c holds – in the true branch you want to show that the minimum is a and in the false branch that the minimum is min b c. However, to discharge each branch you need to “massage” the inequalities: for example, from a ≤ min b c you must deduce a ≤ b (using min_le_left) and a ≤ c (using min_le_right), typically via transitivity.

–––– Step 4. Are there type mismatches or incorrect assumptions? ––––
Yes. In the “if_pos” branch you try to conclude a ≤ b by using “exact h”. But h is a proof of a ≤ min b c, not a proof of a ≤ b. To get from a ≤ min b c to a ≤ b, you need to combine h with the lemma min_le_left b c and use a transitivity rule (like le_trans). The same applies for showing a ≤ c (combine h with min_le_right b c).

Furthermore, the bullet notation “·” must be used carefully in Lean 4. Since Lean is complaining about an “unexpected token '·'”, it is likely that some bullets are mis-indented or placed where Lean expects a different command. (Often a stray bullet means there’s a subproof that was not properly ended.)

–––– Step 5. What alternative proof strategies might work? ––––
A couple of suggestions to fix the proof:

1. In the “if_pos” branch, after “rw if_pos h” you can replace
  · exact h
with a tactic such as
  · apply le_trans h (min_le_left b c)
and similarly use
  · apply le_trans h (min_le_right b c)
to prove the needed inequalities. This correctly uses the transitivity of ≤.

2. Make sure your bullet notation is consistent. In Lean 4 you might prefer to use
  case pos =>
   – tactics for the first branch
  case neg =>
   – tactics for the second branch
or, if you use bullets “·” ensure that all bullets are indented consistently so that Lean knows the extent of each subgoal.

–––– Conclusion: Analysis of the Root Cause and Suggested Fix ––––
The root cause is twofold:
• The proof fails because in the “if_pos” branch you are trying to use the hypothesis h (of type a ≤ min b c) directly to prove statements of the form a ≤ b and a ≤ c. Lean cannot use h in that way because you must pass through the known properties of min (namely, that min b c ≤ b and min b c ≤ c) using transitivity.
• Additionally, the bullet (“·”) tokens are causing a parsing error either because they are mis-indented or misused in the setting of the by_cases proof.

To fix the proof, rework each branch so that you:
– In the if_pos branch, use le_trans with min_le_left and min_le_right to get a ≤ b and a ≤ c.
– Verify that the bullet structure (or use the “case pos => … case neg => …” syntax) is properly formatted so that all subgoals are clearly accounted for.
By making these adjustments, you should be able to discharge all the subgoals and satisfy Lean’s checking.

Hope that helps clarify the issues!
