Below is our step‐by‐step reasoning and plan for solving the problem, followed by our complete Lean 4 implementation and proof.

─────────────────────────────

Step 1. Understand the Function Specification

• The function myMin should take two Int arguments (a and b) and return the smaller of the two.
• When a and b are equal, it is acceptable for the function to return either one.
• In other words, myMin a b must satisfy:
  (result ≤ a ∧ result ≤ b) ∧ (result = a ∨ result = b).

─────────────────────────────

Step 2. Break Down the Problem into Smaller Subproblems

• Implementation: Write a function that uses an if-condition to compare a and b.
  – If a ≤ b then return a; else return b.
• Specification: Define a predicate myMin_spec that exactly captures the two properties described above:
  – The result is less than or equal to a and b.
  – The result is equal to one of the inputs.
• Proof: Prove that myMin meets the specification by:
  – Unfolding the definitions.
  – Splitting the cases based on the if-condition.
  – In the “if a ≤ b” branch, show that the returned value (a) satisfies the bounds.
  – In the “else” branch (i.e. when not (a ≤ b)), note that in a total order the failure of a ≤ b implies b < a. Then show that b satisfies the bounds.

─────────────────────────────

Step 3. Consider Input Types, Edge Cases, and Expected Behavior

• The input numbers are Int values.
• Since the Int order is total in Lean, one of the conditions a ≤ b or b < a always holds.
• When a and b are equal, the condition a ≤ b is true (by the reflexivity law), so the function returns a (which is acceptable).

─────────────────────────────

Step 4. Identify Appropriate Proof Techniques

• Use case analysis on the if-condition (using split_ifs).
• Use the reflexivity properties (e.g., a ≤ a by le_refl).
• For the “else” branch, use the fact that if ¬(a ≤ b), then we must have b < a and hence b ≤ a.
• Use tactic splitting (split) to prove the two parts of the specification (the conjunctions).

─────────────────────────────

Step 5. Note Similar Patterns from Examples

• The examples in the documentation show how to use the “split_ifs” tactic. We will use that.
• We also see the use of “split” for conjunctions and “exact” or “rfl” for equality proofs.
• In the “else” case, we can rely on the property that for any numbers in a total order, if a ≤ b is false then b < a; Lean’s ordering library usually provides that fact.

Detailed Plan

1. Implementation:
  • Define myMin using an if-then-else expression:
    def myMin (a : Int) (b : Int) : Int :=
      if a ≤ b then a else b

2. Specification:
  • Define myMin_spec exactly as given:
    def myMin_spec (a : Int) (b : Int) (result : Int) : Prop :=
      (result ≤ a ∧ result ≤ b) ∧
      (result = a ∨ result = b)

3. Proof:
  • Unfold the definitions of myMin and myMin_spec.
  • Use split_ifs to consider the two scenarios:
    Case 1 (if a ≤ b holds): then result = a.
     – Prove a ≤ a by reflexivity,
     – a ≤ b holds by hypothesis, and
     – a = a, so the equality side of the specification holds.
    Case 2 (if ¬(a ≤ b) holds): then result = b.
     – In a total order, ¬(a ≤ b) implies b < a. Hence we deduce b ≤ a.
     – b ≤ b is again by reflexivity,
     – And b = b, satisfying the equality side.
  • Conclude that in both cases, myMin_spec holds for myMin a b.

Below is the complete Lean 4 implementation following the above plan:

------------------------------------------------
import Mathlib
import Aesop

-- Implementation: Return the smaller of two integers
def myMin (a : Int) (b : Int) : Int :=
  if a ≤ b then a else b

-- Specification: The result is less than or equal to both a and b,
-- and the result is equal to either a or b.
def myMin_spec (a : Int) (b : Int) (result : Int) : Prop :=
  (result ≤ a ∧ result ≤ b) ∧
  (result = a ∨ result = b)

-- Proof that myMin meets the specification.
theorem myMin_spec_satisfied (a : Int) (b : Int) :
  myMin_spec a b (myMin a b) := by
  -- Unfold the definitions
  unfold myMin myMin_spec
  -- Split into cases based on the if-condition in myMin:
  split_ifs with h
  · -- Case 1: a ≤ b holds, so myMin a b = a.
    split
    · -- Prove a ≤ a ∧ a ≤ b.
      constructor
      exact le_refl a
      exact h
    · -- Prove a = a ∨ a = b, here we choose a = a.
      left
      rfl
  · -- Case 2: ¬(a ≤ b) holds, so myMin a b = b.
    split
    · -- We need to show b ≤ a ∧ b ≤ b.
      constructor
      · -- Since Int is totally ordered, ¬(a ≤ b) implies b < a,
        -- and b < a gives b ≤ a.
        exact Int.lt_of_not_ge h
      · -- b ≤ b by reflexivity.
        exact le_refl b
    · -- For the equality side, we choose b = b.
      right
      rfl

------------------------------------------------

Notes on the Proof:

• In the first branch, our hypothesis “h” gives a ≤ b. We then use le_refl for a ≤ a.
• In the second branch, we use the fact that for integers the failure of a ≤ b implies b < a.
  In Lean’s standard library for Int, one may use a lemma like Int.lt_of_not_ge (or prove b < a directly); once we have b < a, it follows that b ≤ a.
• For the equality, rfl (reflexivity of equality) handles both a = a and b = b.
