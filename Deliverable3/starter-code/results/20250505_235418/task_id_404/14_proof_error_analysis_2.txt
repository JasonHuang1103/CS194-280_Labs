Below is a step‐by‐step analysis of the error and the underlying issue:

1. Tactic Failing and Why  
 • In the “then” branch of the split‐if, you write  
  exact ⟨le_refl _, h, Or.inl rfl⟩  
 • The ⟨ … ⟩ syntax is being used to “build” a value of type  
  (myMin_spec a b (myMin a b))  
  which unfolds to  
  ((a ≤ a ∧ a ≤ b) ∧ (a = a ∨ a = b)).  
 • Lean’s notation ⟨…⟩ works only when the target type is an inductive type that has a single constructor which accepts all the fields in order. Here, however, although the first piece (the ∧ of two ≤ facts) comes from And (which does have one constructor, And.intro), the second piece of the pair is (a = a ∨ a = b). The disjunction (∨) is defined as an inductive type with two separate constructors (Or.inl and Or.inr) and does not “bundle” with the And in such a way that you can use a single ⟨ … ⟩ expression to provide all components. As a result Lean complains that you are giving three “fields” to construct a value that it cannot build with a single constructor.

2. Proof State at That Point  
 • After “unfold myMin myMin_spec” and “split_ifs with h”, the goal is reduced to proving  
  ((a ≤ a ∧ a ≤ b) ∧ (a = a ∨ a = b))
 • In the “if” branch, you know that h : a ≤ b holds, and it is clear that a ≤ a holds by reflexivity and that a = a can be chosen.  
 • The structure of the goal is a pair of sub-goals: one that is an “And” (of two ≤ statements) and one that is an “Or” (of equalities). The attempted use of ⟨le_refl _, h, Or.inl rfl⟩ tries to join these together in one “tuple” expression, but because the second component is not a simple record type, this fails.

3. Does the Proof Approach Match the Specification?  
 • Yes. The overall idea—to split on the if condition, prove in each case that  
  (result ≤ a ∧ result ≤ b) ∧ (result = a ∨ result = b)  
  holds—is perfectly correct.  
 • The key issue is only with the method you use to provide the final witness.

4. Type Mismatches or Incorrect Assumptions  
 • The error message specifically says, “invalid constructor ⟨...⟩, expected type must be an inductive type with only one constructor.”  
 • It highlights a mismatch: instead of constructing a witness to an “And” fully, you are trying to embed “Or.inl rfl” as if it were one of the components automatically “packaged” by ⟨ … ⟩.  
 • In other words, the tuple syntax here does not “decompose” into the needed And.intro and then separately the disjunction, causing Lean to complain about the misapplication.

5. Alternative Proof Strategies  
 • One simple solution is to avoid the combined ⟨…⟩ notation and instead build the proof in two steps. For example, you might write: 

  constructor  
   constructor  
    exact le_refl _  
    exact h  
   exact Or.inl rfl  

 • Alternatively, you could use explicit applications of And.intro and the appropriate Or constructor to construct the proof witness.  
 • Breaking the proof into separate constructor applications makes explicit exactly which part of the goal you’re addressing and avoids the pitfalls of using ⟨ … ⟩ in the wrong context.

Conclusion and Root Cause  
 • The root cause of the error is that the ⟨…⟩ notation is used for “tuple‐style” construction of an inductive type that must have exactly one constructor accepting all fields. In your case, the goal is a combination of an “And” and an “Or” (the latter having more than one constructor), so Lean cannot match your triple ⟨le_refl _, h, Or.inl rfl⟩ to the expected structure.  
 • To fix this, you should decompose the proof: use separate constructor applications (either with the “constructor” tactic or by applying And.intro and Or.inl explicitly) so that each logical connector is handled in the appropriate way.

Adapting the proof might look like this:

--------------------------------------------------
theorem myMin_spec_satisfied (a : Int) (b : Int) :
  myMin_spec a b (myMin a b) := by
  unfold myMin myMin_spec
  split_ifs with h
  · constructor
    · constructor
      · exact le_refl a
      · exact h
    · exact Or.inl rfl
  · have h' : b ≤ a := not_le.mp h
    constructor
    · constructor
      · exact h'
      · exact le_refl b
    · exact Or.inr rfl
--------------------------------------------------

This revised proof uses “constructor” to build the And statement and then calls the appropriate Or constructor. This direction fixes the use of the tuple notation and the associated type mismatch.
