Below is a detailed plan outlining the key steps for both the implementation and the proof:

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Implement the Function

• Goal: Define a function ident that takes a natural number x and returns x.
• Implementation: As the function is essentially the identity function, you simply return x.
  - In Lean, you can define this as: def ident (x : Nat) : Nat := x.

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Specify the Function's Behavior

• Goal: Define ident_spec so that it expresses the specification that the result equals the input.
• Implementation: Write the predicate as ident_spec (x : Nat) (result: Nat) : Prop := result = x.

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. Prove That The Implementation Meets the Specification

• Goal: Prove the theorem ident_spec_satisfied which states that for every natural number x, ident x satisfies ident_spec x.
• Proof Outline:
  1. Begin with the theorem statement: theorem ident_spec_satisfied (x : Nat) : ident_spec x (ident x).
  2. Unfold the definitions of ident and ident_spec. After unfolding:
       - ident x becomes x,
       - and ident_spec x (ident x) becomes x = x.
  3. Recognize that the equality x = x holds by reflexivity.
  4. Conclude the proof by using the reflexivity tactic (rfl) since every value is equal to itself.

──────────────────────────────
Step 4. Fill in the Lean Template

Replace the placeholders in the template as follows:

• For the code section, place x as the return value.
• For the proof section, after unfolding the definitions, use rfl to complete the proof.

──────────────────────────────
Summary:

1. Implementation: Define the function ident to simply return its input.
2. Specification: Express that the result must equal the input.
3. Proof: Unfold the definitions, reducing the goal to proving x = x, and finish by noting that the statement is true by reflexivity (rfl).

By following these clear steps, you'll both meet the problem requirements and produce a correct Lean 4 proof.
