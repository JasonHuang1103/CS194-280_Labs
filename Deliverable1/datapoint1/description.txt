This task requires writing a Lean 4 method that calculates the punishment number of a given positive integer. The punishment number of n is defined as the sum of the squares of all integers i (where 1 <= i <= n) such that the decimal representation of i^2 can be partitioned into contiguous substrings that sum to i.

-----Input-----
The input consists of one integer:
n: A positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000)

-----Output-----
The output is an integer:
Returns the punishment number of n, which is the sum of i^2 for all integers i from 1 to n where i^2 can be partitioned into contiguous substrings that sum to i.
