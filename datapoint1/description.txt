-----Description----- 
This task requires writing a Lean 4 method that determines if it's possible to traverse between all pairs of indices in an array. Given a 0-indexed integer array, you can traverse between indices i and j (where i != j) if and only if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the values at those indices is greater than 1. The method should return true if it's possible to traverse between all pairs of indices i and j (where i < j), and false otherwise.

-----Input-----
The input consists of a list of integers:
nums: A 0-indexed integer array where 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5 and 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5.

-----Output-----
The output is a boolean:
Returns true if it's possible to traverse between all pairs of indices i and j (where i < j), and false otherwise.

-----Example 1-----
Input: nums = [2, 3, 6]
Output: true
Explanation: For the pair (0, 1), we can use the sequence 0 -> 2 -> 1, because gcd(nums[0], nums[2]) = gcd(2, 6) = 2 > 1 and gcd(nums[2], nums[1]) = gcd(6, 3) = 3 > 1. For pairs (0, 2) and (1, 2), we can go directly since their respective gcds are greater than 1.

-----Example 2-----
Input: nums = [3, 9, 5]
Output: false
Explanation: No sequence of traversals can take us from index 0 to index 2.

-----Example 3-----
Input: nums = [4, 3, 12, 8]
Output: true
Explanation: A valid sequence of traversals exists for each pair of indices.
